\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Edward Topp, for introducing me to the wonderful world of microbiology almost four years ago today --- your continuous mentorship has been invaluable, and I will always be grateful for the many research opportunities that you've provided to me.
Next, I would like to thank my co-supervisor, Dr. Vera Tai, for her continuous mentorship throughout this thesis project and for allowing me to join her weekly online lab meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Thank you both for your detailed comments and revisions on previous drafts of this thesis.

Thank you to my advisors, Dr. Marc-Andr√© Lachance and Dr. Hugh Henry, for all of your guidance and support throughout this project.
I would also like to thank the lab technicians of the Topp Lab:
Roger Murray, Andrew Scott, Yuan-Ching Tien, and Lou Ann Verellen, for all of their technical support and guidance over the past four years --- this work would not be possible without you.
Many thanks to my past and present labmates for their personal and professional support.

Finally, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to my friends, family, and my partner for their incredible support and words of encouragement over the past two years.
