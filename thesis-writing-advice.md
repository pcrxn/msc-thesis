### Introduction

#### Structure of the Introduction

1. Describe a situation.

2. Describe a problem or question that arises from that situation.

  - The problem or question that arose/arises from the situation/stimulus

3. Describe how others have approached that problem or question.

  - A response or partial answer to the question, or other consequences of the stimulus

4. Explain a need to approach it in a different way or expand upon what's been done.

5. Say what you aim to do...

#### Things to keep in-mind when writing the Introduction

* You do not have to show how much you have read
* Every paper you read is a response to a problem/question/situation

### The writing process

* Be okay with feeling discomfort!

  - Slow down, take time to think, and give yourself the opportunity to solve and push through the problem

* You can't be certain of the end-result, but you can be certain that you can accept the end-result
