# Discussion

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of long-term antibiotic exposure on the soil bacterial community, resistome, and mobilome.
We sought to determine if a low, environmentally realistic dose of macrolide antibiotics that could be expected to result from a biosolids exposure scenario promoted antibiotic resistance in agricultural soil.
By sequencing bacterial 16S rDNA amplicons, metagenomic DNA, and integron gene cassette amplicons from antibiotic-exposed and -unexposed soil, we determined that an annual, unrealistically high dose of antibiotics increased the diversity and altered the composition of the soil resistome and mobilome over 10 years by co-selecting for non-macrolide antibiotic resistance genes.
We also determined that a realistic dose of macrolide antibiotics did not significantly affect the soil resistome or mobilome, and that neither dose affected the overall diversity or composition of the soil bacterial community or integron gene cassettes.

## High macrolide antibiotic exposure enriches genes that are known to confer resistance to non-macrolide, ribosome-targeting antibiotic drug classes

A high dose of macrolide antibiotics increased the number of unique antibiotic resistance genes that were detected within the soil metagenome (Figure \ref{fig:chao1-richness}a).
The majority of antibiotic resistance genes that were detected in the metagenome were detected within all three groups (control, low, and high), but approximately twice as many unique antibiotic resistance genes were detected within the high treatment group alone than the control and low groups alone (Supplementary Figure \ref{supp-figure:args-mges-compartment-size}).
Because we exposed the soil plots to a solution of antibiotics instead of an application of antibiotic-contaminated biosolids, the most likely explanation for the increased number of unique antibiotic resistance genes in the high-dosed soil is selection for antibiotic resistances that were below the detection limit in the control and low groups, but were raised above the limit of detection by high antibiotic exposure.

In addition, a high dose of macrolide antibiotics changed the composition of antibiotic resistance genes within the soil metagenome (Figure \ref{fig:pca-ordplots-args-mges-integrons}a), and this effect extended to when antibiotic resistance genes were grouped by several drug classes (Figure \ref{fig:pca-ordplots-drug-classes}).
These differences in composition indicated that the relative abundances of several antibiotic resistance genes and target drug classes were more similar within the high-dosed soil than in the control and low-dosed soil.
The altered composition of antibiotic resistance genes in the high-dosed soil was driven by increased relative abundances of 21 antibiotic resistance genes in the high dose --- only two of which are known to confer resistance to macrolide antibiotics in the CARD database \parencite{Alcock.2020}.
The increased relative abundances of non-macrolide antibiotic resistance genes strongly suggests co-selection via co-resistance, which could be facilitated by mobile genetic elements \parencite{Pal.2015}.

Co-resistance to different drug classes of antibiotics can occur due to the genetic linkage of ARGs on MGEs such as class 1 integrons (62) or when antibiotic resistance genes are carried within the same host.
Of the 21 increased ARGs in the unrealistically high dosed-soil metagenome, eight are known to be associated with class 1 integrons (*sul1*, *aac(3)-Ib*, *aadA*, *aadA15*, *aadA22*, *aadA24*, *dfrA17*, *dfrA15*), which agrees with the increased relative abundance of *intI1* in the high dose.
Of the remaining antibiotic resistance genes, five are known to be carried on plasmids in human pathogens (*sul2*, *aac(6')-Ib7*, *pp-flo*, *mphE*, *ant(3'')-IIa*), *tet(33)* is carried by the insertion sequence IS6100, and aph(3’’)-Ib / strA is carried by several MGEs (83) . The ARG aph(3’)-IIb is chromosomally encoded, and the remaining increased ARGs chromosomally encode components of antibiotic efflux pumps in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (oprN, mexH, triC, mexQ) or Burkholderia spp. (opcM) (83).

Of the 21 increased antibiotic resistance genes in the high-dosed soil, eight are known to be carried within class 1 integrons:
*aac(3)-Ib*, *aadA*, *aadA15*, *aadA22*, *aadA24*, *dfrA17*, *dfrA15* are carried within gene cassettes \parencite{Partridge.2009, Yan.2006, Herrero.2008}; and *sul1* is a component of the class 1 integron 3' conserved sequence.
The corresponding increase in *intI1* suggests that the increased relative abundances of these resistance genes in the high-dosed soil could have been due to co-selection of at least one gene-cassette embedded macrolide resistance gene, along with one or more of these other genes located within the same integron gene cassette array.
Of these increased genes that are known to be carried within gene cassettes, however, only *aac(6')-IIa* was identified with high-confidence in the integron gene cassette sequence data, and its relative abundance was significantly increased only in the low-dosed soil (*W* = 4.0 +- 0.4).






\todo{Reasons for why these genes were increased but not detected in the cassette metagenome data?
Could be because the integron gene cassette primers that we used target other classes of integrons, and we didn't sequence enough to find them.
}


* Composition of antibiotic resistance genes was changed in the high dose
* 21 antibiotic resistance genes were increased in the high dose, while only 3 were increased in the low dose
  - Of the 21 increased antibiotic resistance genes, most (16) conferred resistance to antibiotic drug classes with the same target site as macrolides
  - Only 2 of the increased antibiotic resistance genes are known to confer resistance to macrolides
  - Many of the increased genes are associated with class 1 integron gene cassettes or co-occur with class 1 integrons in linkage clusters of co-abundance

## High macrolide antibiotic exposure enriches transposases, intI1, and biocide resistance genes

* Richness of mobile genetic elements was increased in the high dose
* Composition of mobile genetic elements was changed in the high dose
* 23 mobile genetic element variants were increased in the high dose
  - 15 of these were tnpA, but the mobile genetic element of the greatest effect size was intI1

## Low and high macrolide antibiotic exposure reduces the abundance of b-lactam antibiotic resistance genes

## High macrolide exposure reduces the abundance of Cyanobacteria

## Macrolide antibiotic exposure increases the abundance of unknown Acidobacteria (low) and Chloroflexi (high) taxa

In this study, we detected increased relative abundances of three bacterial taxa in the realistically dosed soil (Supplementary Table 1), but we did not detect any differences in the overall diversity or composition of the soil bacterial community (Supplementary Figure 1; Supplementary Figure 2; Supplementary Figure 3; Supplementary Figure 4).
The effect sizes for two of these species were relatively low (W < 5), but an unknown Subgroup 6 Acidobacterium ASV was over 45-times more abundant in the realistically dosed soil than the control (W = 45.79) . This ASV was present in both antibiotic treated groups but not in the control soil.

Acidobacteria are a largely uncultivated (150), highly abundant bacterial phylum in Canadian agricultural soil (151) and play an important role in shaping the soil bacterial community through their decomposition of organic carbon (152).
Furthermore, Acidobacteria are a known reservoir of macrolide antibiotic resistance in urban surface waters (20) and have been reported to be increased in macrolide-polluted sediments (153). Conservatively, the unknown Subgroup 6 Acidobacterium taxon may represent a macrolide-resistant decomposer, but more speculatively, could represent a species that is able to use macrolides as an alternative source of carbon.
Further studies would be required to investigate the macrolide biodegradation potential of this Acidobacteria taxon.

We identified two bacterial ASVs classified as unknown Chloroflexi Gitt-GS-136 spp. that were approximately 23- and 58-times more relatively abundant in the unrealistically high dosed soil compared to the control (Supplementary Table 1). Chloroflexi are fastidious bacteria with diverse metabolisms (162, 163) and, like Acidobacteria, are a known reservoir of macrolide resistance in the environment (20), though their overall role in environmental antibiotic resistance is still poorly understood. Chloroflexi have also been reported as increased in macrolide-polluted sediments (153).

## Integron gene cassette diversity and composition were unaffected by macrolide exposure

* X genes predicted to confer resistance to macrolides with high-confidence
* Our feature picking for large effect sizes could be used to predict ARGs for functional analysis

## Strengths and limitations

In the present study, we detected all 10 antibiotic resistance genes that were previously reported to be increased in the same soil plots after eight years of high macrolide exposure, and our differential abundance analysis revealed six of these genes to be significantly increased (*sul1*, *sul2*, *aph(3'')-Ib* / *strA*, *mphE*, ) while the remaining four were unchanged (*aadA2*, *aph(6)-Id* / *strB*, *aadA17*, *msrE*) (*W* = -0.68 to 3.24) \parencite{Lau.2020}.
The detection of all 10 antibiotic resistance genes, and the agreement of our compositional data analysis with a treatment effect for six of these genes, provides confidence that our methods detected real changes in the relative abundances of gene targets in response to antibiotic exposure.
Our inability to detect increased abundances for the four other antibiotic resistance genes that were increased in the previous study may be due to an underrepresentation of these genes in our metagenomic DNA due to technical bias, or these ARGs may have decreased in absolute abundance since the last quantitative PCR measurement.
