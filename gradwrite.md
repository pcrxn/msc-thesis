# GRADWrite Series

## The writing process: Organizing and structuring your work

* There is a gap between what *grad students* think they are doing when they write and what *professors* think grad students are doing when they write
  - Professors complain about organization and structure of grad writing

* When reading the literature, it's useful to think about *where* the paper is going to be referenced in your thesis

* Emphasizing the date of the cited study or author's work can create a narrative
  - "*As early as 1996*, Bhabha coined the term global warming to explain these co-existing processes. *Following Bhabha*, I am addressing current trends in climate change studies that connect global warming to the mass extinction of species"\

* Students try to show how much they know and how much they have read, regardless of whether it's relevant to their argument

* **Performative writing**: Morphological acrobatics, complexity, academic speak.
  - You don't need to prove that you're part of the club

* Apply mindfulness to your writing process
  - If you find yourself on a tangent/distracted, take a moment to identify the source of the distraction and notice it

* Your thesis is just one of many on a shelf!
  - Your supervisor and committee just want it complete and in before the deadline

## Editing as a process

* Editing and writing should be separate processes

* When you finish writing a draft, avoid looking at it for at least 4-5 days

* Avoid ending paragraphs with citations
  - When you do this, you're signaling the reader to go to the cited paper

## Refining your grammar

### Nouns

* Subjects perform the action (active)
* Objects are affected by the action (passive)
* Adjectives change nouns

### Passive voice

* The natural sentence structure for spoken English
  - e.g. "Hey, Mom! The window was broken!"
  - e.g. "The samples were prepared using a 50 mL buret."

### Appositives

* Information that comes after the subject noun
  - e.g. "Mick Jagger, *the lead singer of the Rolling Stones*, is a good dancer"
  - Information stuck between the subject noun and its verb

### Non-restrictive clauses

* Appositives are an example of a non-restrictive clause

* e.g. "Human brains have billions of neurons, *which determine movement through the nervous system*"
  - Appositive e.g. "Human brains, *which have billions of neurons*, determine movement through the nervous system"

### Restrictive clauses

* e.g. "Human brains *that are afflicted by Parkinson's Disease* cannot properly determine movement"
* The restrictive clause *restricts* the subject

### Misplaced modifiers

* e.g. "Floating in a glass jar, I looked at the specimen of the human brain"
  - Fix: "I looked the specimen of the human brain floating in a glass jar"

### Dangling modifiers

* e.g. "While riding my bicycle, a bee stung me"
  - Fix: "While I was riding my bicycle, a bee stung me"
  - Fix: "Which I was riding a bicycle, I was stung by a bee"

### Participles

* Present participle: Describes action that the noun is performing.
* Past participle: Describes an action that was performed on the noun.

### Gerunds

* *Listening* to music helps me to sleep
  - Listening = gerund
  - Helps = verb
  - Sleep = adverb

### Infinitives

* "*To be or not to be*, that is the question"
* A verb with "to" in front of it

## Summarizing your research into an abstract

* Ask yourself: Who is your audience?

* For a thesis or dissertation at Western, abstracts must include the following:
  - A statement of the research problem or question
  - An indication of the methods used
  - Findings or major discoveries made
  - A concluding statement

### Keywords

* The abstract should include important place names and proper nouns because these can be significant keywords for electronic retrieval

### Purpose

* *Publishers* look at your abstract to determine if your paper will fulfill their publication criteria

* *Researchers* read to determine if your paper should be a part of their research

* When writing an abstract for a conference, you should write it as though you have finished your research, even though it's usually written before the results are in or the paper is finished
  - You aren't required to provide a point-by-point list of what you will talk about
  - Less formal than journal abstracts
  - Use *only* the space needed, not given
  - **READ THE INSTRUCTIONS**
  - Sometimes deadlines for submission aren't hard deadlines
  - e.g. "This research will provide important insights into..."
    - If results not yet generated, can talk about what we may learn from the experiment

### Qualities of an abstract

* An abstract is a *stand-alone* document
  - You don't have to worry about repeating parts of your Introduction!
  - Includes a synopsis of the major elements of the larger text (in order)
  - Shouldn't include any new information

* In the sciences, you abstract should answer the following:
  1. Why does your study need to be undertaken?
  2. How did you conduct your study?
  3. What were the results of your study?
  4. **What is the relevancy of your research?**

* Your first sentence should be a *hook*
  - Could be a startling statistic, a controversial issue, etc.

* Abstracts often end with a concluding statement which focuses on the significance or relevancy of the work

### Chunking for abstracts

* Chunking is a term referring to the process of identifying pieces of writing to understand their relationship to the whole work
  - Ask yourself: Is this chuck of my paper necessary for the reader of my **abstract** to know about?

* As your are writing your thesis:
  - Identify the key points for each chunk
  - Ask: What does each chunk do?
  - Generate short key sentences from each chuck

### Style for writing abstracts

* Verb tenses depend on the discipline
* An abstract is not the place to show off the complexity of your thinking or your rhetorical acrobatics
* Avoid jargon, exclusionary terminology, acronyms
  - Unless the acronym is very obvious in your discipline

* Avoid ambiguity!
  - Avoid pronouns by stating the name of the thing itself (i.e. avoid "it")

* Abstracts differ from journal to journal, supervisor to supervisor

## Punctuation

### Commas

* It is absolutely *not* the case that you use a comma wherever you need to take a breath
* Separates sentences by different items and clauses

#### Most common uses of the comma

1. Items in a list.

  - "I made a sandwich with ham, tomato, lettuce, mayo, and Swiss cheese"
    - Last comma is an Oxford comma

2. Prepositional/transitional words or phrases.

  - "Linda has caught a cold. *As a result*, she will be unable to attend tonight's ceremony."
  - "*Last Thursday*, we took a trip up to the cottage."

3. Compound sentences.

  - "Calvin likes airplanes, he wants to be a pilot."
    - Comma splice: Two subjects nouns, two verbs, comma only
  - "Calvin likes airplanes he wants to be a pilot."
    - Run-on sentence/fused sentence
  - "Calvin likes airplanes. He wants to be a pilot."

  - Coordinating conjunctions:
    - "I like Western, but I hate the 9 am classes."
      - Could say "I like Western but hate the 9 am classes."
        - Comma removed because subject noun removed ("I")
    - "I like reading, and I love rock climbing."
      - "I like reading and love rock climbing."

4. Complex sentences.

  - Have dependent and independent clauses.
  - "He came to me because he needed help."
    - No comma needed if the dependent clause is at the **end** of the sentence.

5. Non-restrictive clauses and appositives.

  - "Leon Trotsky, *one of the early leaders of the Soviet Union*, was murdered in Mexico."

### Apostrophes

* Indicate possession
* You *shouldn't* use contractions in academic writings
  - Can't, shouldn't, it's

### Colons

* Reveal a list or series preceded by a complete main clause

### Semicolons

* Separate two independent clauses that are *closely related*
  - "The car veered wildly down the street; Shawn was trying to impress his girlfriend again."
* Or use a conjunction instead...
  - "The car veered wildly down the street because Shawn was trying to impress his girlfriend again."
* "Shawn was trying to impress his girlfriend again; however, he failed."
  - 'However' could also be between two commas if it was after 'Shawn', the subject noun
    - "Shawn, however, was trying to impress his girlfriend"
* When you have a complicated list of items:
  - "The Avengers are Steve Rogers, Captain America; Tony Stark, Iron Man; Natasha Romanov, Black Widow; and Thor."

### Dashes and hyphens

* Dashes are used sparingly in formal writing:
  - Series beginning a sentence: "Celebrities, professional athletes, business moguls - all have little appreciation for the financial hardships of the average person."
  - Series in the middle of a sentence: "It has everything - size, speed, versatility - that he looks for in a cell phone."

* There's no set of rules for forming compound words with hyphens -- consult a dictionary if unsure

### Quotation marks

* Use when you are repeating another person's statement word-for-word

### Numbers

* Not punctuation marks, but still important to know the rules!
* Use the word if the number is **twelve or less**
* All numbers that are *values* should be expressed as numerals

## Writing effective research proposals

* For scholarships and grants v. supervisor and department
* *Failure is the part of the process*
  - Most scholarship proposals are not successful the first time!

### Proposals for scholarships and grants

* Pay attention to calls for papers in conferences -- these are an indicator of where the interest will be in a couple of years
* Sub-headings can be useful
* Timelines give the project a sense of organizational structure
* Piggy-backing on previous work gives the reader the sense that there's a greater likelihood your project will succeed
* Gatekeeper approval (approval from the necessary individuals) makes the proposal more fundable

### Proposals for supervisor and department

* What does it do?
  - Communicates
  - Plans
  - Acts as a contract

* Your research proposal determines:
  - Your thesis or dissertation
  - Your committee
  - Possibilities for funding
  - Your academic life for the next X years
  - The form of your research
    - Will your proposal produce a study, installation, clinical trial, theory, product, digital media...?

### The target audience

1. Supervisor
  - If your supervisor is very busy, you can use other resources like the Writing Support Centre for feedback

2. Multidisciplinary selection committee appointed by the granting body (NSERC, CIHR)
  - For an audience that is not familiar with your research, and often not even familiar with your particular field
  - You must:
    - Be exceedingly clear, not relying on mystical discipline-specific jargon
    - Identify the *relevancy* of the project you're proposing
    - Justify your proposal without relying on your audience's familiarity with prior literature/studies/research

* What do Tri-Council selection committee members say about how to write a successful proposal?

  1. "It should be a pleasure to read."
  2. "Write a compelling narrative."
  3. "Write it so anyone can enjoy it."
  4. "You need to begin by doing an elevator pitch in three sentences, and you have to be passionate about it. It's increasingly important. You need a straight shot into why it matters."
  5. "We are looking for the story."
  6. "Grab the reader by the throat. Then come back and grab them by the throat again."
    - What is the impact for *Canada*?
    - Why is *Western* the place to do this research?

### Tips for readability

* Use whitespace
* Use subheadings

### Research proposal: The goal

* Your argument must contain:
  1. A clear statement of *what* your project is.
  2. An account of *why* your project is one that needs to be undertaken (from the literature).
  3. An account of *how* you intend to achieve your stated goals.
    - Overall research design
    - How will results be reported
    - Types of data and analysis
    - **Time frame**
  4. A clear indication of anticipated results.
    - How will your research add to existing knowledge/raise further questions?
    - Demonstrates how *you* are thinking about what you are investigating

* **Knowledge mobilization**:
  - Must address at least one of the following:
    - Within academia:
      - Informs, advances and/or improves:
        - Research agendas;
        - Theory; and/or
        - Methods
    - Beyond academia:
      - Informs:
        - Public debate;
        - Policies; and/or
        - Practice
    - Enhances/improves services; and/or
    - Informs the decisions and/or processes of people in business, government, the media, practitioner communities and civil society

### Research proposal for your degree: The goal

* Convince other academics that your project has academic value
* Show that your research *question* can be defended
  - To clearly present how you intend to address or develop your research question
* If you do what you say you'll do in your proposal, you'll have a defendable thesis

### Research proposal: The style

* Be direct:
  - e.g. "There are two objectives. The project has three phases. The research builds on studies by..."
* Avoid pronouns ("it, this, that, their, these")
* State the name of the thing itself: **Don't be afraid to duplicate language**
* "I" versus "we"
  - Use "I" more than "we", especially in the sciences!
  - You need to demonstrate you are an independent scholar
* Use authoritative language:
  - A research proposal is no place for modesty!

### NSERC Discovery Grant merit of the proposal: Exceptional

> "Proposed research program is clearly presented, is extremely original and innovative and is likely to have impact by leading to groundbreaking advances. Long-term vision and short-term objectives are clearly defined. The methodology is clearly defined and appropriate. The application clearly demonstrates how the research activities are distinct."

### Research proposal: The budget

* Demonstrates that you know what you're doing
* **Not** a wish list
* Corresponds to the research design
* Necessary and sufficient

### Research proposal: The literature review

* May be the main argument in your proposal and *only* justification for getting approval
* Has continuity with all other sections of the research proposal
* Presents the literature in a manner the *perpares the reader for your project*
