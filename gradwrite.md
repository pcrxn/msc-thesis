# GRADWrite Series

## The writing process: Organizing and structuring your work

* There is a gap between what *grad students* think they are doing when they write and what *professors* think grad students are doing when they write
  - Professors complain about organization and structure of grad writing

* When reading the literature, it's useful to think about *where* the paper is going to be referenced in your thesis

* Emphasizing the date of the cited study or author's work can create a narrative
  - "*As early as 1996*, Bhabha coined the term global warming to explain these co-existing processes. *Following Bhabha*, I am addressing current trends in climate change studies that connect global warming to the mass extinction of species"\

* Students try to show how much they know and how much they have read, regardless of whether it's relevant to their argument

* **Performative writing**: Morphological acrobatics, complexity, academic speak.
  - You don't need to prove that you're part of the club

* Apply mindfulness to your writing process
  - If you find yourself on a tangent/distracted, take a moment to identify the source of the distraction and notice it

* Your thesis is just one of many on a shelf!
  - Your supervisor and committee just want it complete and in before the deadline

## Editing as a process

* Editing and writing should be separate processes

* When you finish writing a draft, avoid looking at it for at least 4-5 days

* Avoid ending paragraphs with citations
  - When you do this, you're signaling the reader to go to the cited paper

## Refining your grammar

### Nouns

* Subjects perform the action (active)
* Objects are affected by the action (passive)
* Adjectives change nouns

### Passive voice

* The natural sentence structure for spoken English
  - e.g. "Hey, Mom! The window was broken!"
  - e.g. "The samples were prepared using a 50 mL buret."

### Appositives

* Information that comes after the subject noun
  - e.g. "Mick Jagger, *the lead singer of the Rolling Stones*, is a good dancer"
  - Information stuck between the subject noun and its verb

### Non-restrictive clauses

* Appositives are an example of a non-restrictive clause

* e.g. "Human brains have billions of neurons, *which determine movement through the nervous system*"
  - Appositive e.g. "Human brains, *which have billions of neurons*, determine movement through the nervous system"

### Restrictive clauses

* e.g. "Human brains *that are afflicted by Parkinson's Disease* cannot properly determine movement"
* The restrictive clause *restricts* the subject

### Misplaced modifiers

* e.g. "Floating in a glass jar, I looked at the specimen of the human brain"
  - Fix: "I looked the specimen of the human brain floating in a glass jar"

### Dangling modifiers

* e.g. "While riding my bicycle, a bee stung me"
  - Fix: "While I was riding my bicycle, a bee stung me"
  - Fix: "Which I was riding a bicycle, I was stung by a bee"

### Participles

* Present participle: Describes action that the noun is performing.
* Past participle: Describes an action that was performed on the noun.

### Gerunds

* *Listening* to music helps me to sleep
  - Listening = gerund
  - Helps = verb
  - Sleep = adverb

### Infinitives

* "*To be or not to be*, that is the question"
* A verb with "to" in front of it

## Summarizing your research into an abstract

* Ask yourself: Who is your audience?

* For a thesis or dissertation at Western, abstracts must include the following:
  - A statement of the research problem or question
  - An indication of the methods used
  - Findings or major discoveries made
  - A concluding statement

### Keywords

* The abstract should include important place names and proper nouns because these can be significant keywords for electronic retrieval

### Purpose

* *Publishers* look at your abstract to determine if your paper will fulfill their publication criteria

* *Researchers* read to determine if your paper should be a part of their research

* When writing an abstract for a conference, you should write it as though you have finished your research, even though it's usually written before the results are in or the paper is finished
  - You aren't required to provide a point-by-point list of what you will talk about
  - Less formal than journal abstracts
  - Use *only* the space needed, not given
  - **READ THE INSTRUCTIONS**
  - Sometimes deadlines for submission aren't hard deadlines
  - e.g. "This research will provide important insights into..."
    - If results not yet generated, can talk about what we may learn from the experiment

### Qualities of an abstract

* An abstract is a *stand-alone* document
  - You don't have to worry about repeating parts of your Introduction!
  - Includes a synopsis of the major elements of the larger text (in order)
  - Shouldn't include any new information

* In the sciences, you abstract should answer the following:
  1. Why does your study need to be undertaken?
  2. How did you conduct your study?
  3. What were the results of your study?
  4. **What is the relevancy of your research?**

* Your first sentence should be a *hook*
  - Could be a startling statistic, a controversial issue, etc.

* Abstracts often end with a concluding statement which focuses on the significance or relevancy of the work

### Chuncking for abstracts

* Chunking is a term referring to the process of identifying pieces of writing to understand their relationship to the whole work
  - Ask yourself: Is this chuck of my paper necessary for the reader of my **abstract** to know about?

* As your are writing your thesis:
  - Identify the key points for each chunk
  - Ask: What does each chunk do?
  - Generate short key sentences from each chuck

### Style for writing abstracts

* Verb tenses depend on the discipline
* An abstract is not the place to show off the complexity of your thinking or your rhetorical acrobatics
* Avoid jargon, exclusionary terminology, acronyms
  - Unless the acronym is very obvious in your discipline

* Avoid ambiguity!
  - Avoid pronouns by stating the name of the thing itself (i.e. avoid "it")

* Abstracts differ from journal to journal, supervisor to supervisor
