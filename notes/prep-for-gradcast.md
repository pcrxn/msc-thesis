Qualification **I may mix use the terms 'antibiotic resistance' and 'antimicrobial resistance' interchangeably; I'll try to stick to 'antibiotic resistance' because this is the term that's specific to bacteria.**

## The history of antibiotic resistance

Simply put: **Antibiotic resistance** is the natural phenomenon that occurs when a bacterium acquires or develops resistance to a harmful chemical in its environment.
An **antibiotic** is a chemical that is harmful to bacteria.

I would argue that antibiotic resistance can largely be thought of as a history of chemical warfare:
  - Warfare of bacterium on bacterium (beginning over 2 BYA),
  - Warfare of bacteria on humans (beginning 300,000 YA),
  - Warfare of humans on bacteria (began in the early 1900's but really kicked off in the mid-1900's with the introduction of benzylpenicillin to the market),
  - Warfare of bacteria v. humans again (following the 1950's until today, with the continued rise of multi-drug drug resistance)

### Chemical warfare of bacterium on bacterium

In order to fully understand antibiotic resistance as it pertains to humans today, we have to understand that antibiotic resistance is ancient.
The story of antibiotic resistance begins at least 2 BYA:
This is *after* the divergence of bacteria from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage (which occurred at least 2.5 BYA), but antibiotic resistance began *before* the divergence of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
In order for bacteria to compete with one-another for resources in the ocean of this more primitive Earth, they had to possess offensive and defensive mechanisms:
The offensive mechanism was **antibiotic production** and the defensive mechanism was antibiotic resistance.
In addition, bacteria that produce antibiotics must *also* possess mechanisms to avoid dying from that same compound that they're producing; so, you can see how this competition could have quickly led to the evolution of diverse and elaborate mechanisms of antibiotic production and antibiotic resistance.

### Chemical warfare of bacteria on humans

Now, let's move onto the time when humans enter the picture, about 300,000 YA.
During this period, humans attempted to treat infection with a variety of herbal remedies mixed with ritualistic and spiritualistic practices.
From this time, until the early 1900's when the Germ Theory of Disease had gained traction, a bacterial infection was basically a death sentence if your body couldn't fight the infection.
In this chemical warfare of bacteria on humans, there was a clear winner: the bacteria.

### Chemical warfare of humans on bacteria

In 1911, the tide began to turn.
The first antibiotic, arsphenamine, came to the drug market as a treatment for syphilis -- it was actually a **synthetic antibiotic**, meaning that it was made in a laboratory and was not discovered in a microorganism.
In 1942, **benzylpenicillin** came to the drug market during the Second World War for treatment of a number of bacterial infections, including pneumonia and strep throat.
Over 1 billion units of penicillin accompanied soldiers on the beaches of Normandy in World War 2.
And these discoveries ushered in the **Golden Age of Antibiotic Drug Discovery**, which is typically described as the years from 1930-1960 when there was a massive discovery of new classes of antibiotics, many from environmental microorganisms.

### Chemical warfare of bacteria on humans (again)

However, because of the overconsumption and misuse of antibiotics in healthcare and agriculture, antibiotic resistance quickly became wide-spread.
Penicillin resistance was observed in *S. aureus* soon after the drug came to the market, and today, nearly all *S. aureus* strains are resistant to penicillin -- many more are becoming resistant to methicillin (**MRSA**), and some are becoming resistant to the drug of last-resort, vancomycin.
To make matters worse, we are in a **Drug Discovery Void** right now:
The most recent class of antibiotics to have reached the market was discovered in 1987 (34 YA), so we are in a **discovery void** right now.
No new major antibiotic classes have come to the market since then.

### Biosolids

**Biosolids** (AKA treated sewage sludge) are produced when a WWTP separates wastewater into liquid and solids, and then the solids are treated to reduce pathogens and odour.
Treatment can involve heat treatment,
In Ontario, biosolids are classified as Category 3 non-agricultural source materials, and as a farmer, you must have an approved plan to apply biosolids to your fields.
The purpose of applying biosolids to agricultural soil is to:
  - Improve soil fertility, which reduces the need for inorganic fertilizer
  - And to add organic matter to the soil, which enhances soil structure and moisture retention, while reducing potential for erosion
Some crops that they're suitable for are:
  - Corn and hay (compatible with nitrogren introduced by the biosolids)
  - Cereals, perennial legumes, soybeans

### Wastewater Treatment

* Chlorination is the most common form of waste water disinfection in North America
* "Techniques for elimination of micropollutants via a fourth treatment stage during sewage treatment are implemented in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden[citation needed] and the Netherlands and tests are ongoing in several other countries"
  - Activated carbon filters

### Macrolide antibiotics

* Erythromycin was the first macrolide antibiotic (discovered in *Saccharopolyspora erythraea*), was commonly used as a substitute for penicillin in individuals with allergies to penicillin

"Macrolide antibiotics have been identified as “critically important” by the World Health Organization because of their use as first-line and sole treatments of serious human infections, such as *community-acquired pneumonia* and *campylobacteriosis*. The extensive use of macrolides in healthcare and agriculture has led to increased drug resistance among historically susceptible bacterial species, and of particular concern is the possibility for these antibiotics to promote resistance in the environment via fertilization of agricultural soil with macrolide-contaminated manure or biosolids. To investigate if long-term exposure of agricultural soil to macrolides promotes resistance in environmental bacteria, soil microplots in London, ON were exposed annually to a mixture of three macrolide antibiotics, and an increase in several resistance genes was observed over time. The goal of my research is to investigate the role of mobile genetic elements in the dissemination of resistance genes in these soil bacteria using culture-based and next-generation sequencing methods."

* Campylobacteriosis = traveler's diarrhea

### AAFC

One of the mandates of the **Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada** Science and Technology Branch is to assess the risk of environmental issues in regards to potential disruption of the agriculture and agri-food food-chain.

### Evidence of ancient antibiotic resistance

Ancient bacterial DNA has been recovered from 30,000 year-old permafrost cores and antimicrobial resistance genes were detected to b-lactam, tetracycline, and glycopeptide antibiotics.
Based on the rates of evolution of bacterial DNA sequences, the oldest estimation for an antibiotic biosynthetic pathway is over 2 BYA for beta-lactamases, which pre-dates the divergence of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (referenced by wrightAntibioticResistomeNexus2007).

### Gram-positive v. Gram-negative bacteria

**Gram-positive** bacteria lack an outer cellular membrane as in **Gram-negative** bacteria, but they have a thick layer of peptidoglycan outside of their plasma membrane, which means that different antibiotics are effective for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

### HGT v. spontaneous mutation as drivers of antibiotic resistance

When we think about antibiotic resistance in the clinic, we often think about antibiotic resistance that has been acquired through horizontal gene transfer, but in some species of bacteria (e.g. *H. pylori*, *M. tuberculosis*), spontaneous mutations are a larger driver of resistance, and some strains of bacteria are hypermutable, which means that they have an increased rate of mutation.

### SOS response

When bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, they activate their SOS repair response, which is used to increase the rate of DNA repair at the cost of more error-prone mistakes.
Some of these error-prone mistakes confer resistance to antibiotics.
