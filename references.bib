ARGs can be spread via HGT, though mechanisms are known and have been shown to depend on the environment, bacterial communities and mobile genetic elements. Classically, HGT mechanisms include conjugation, transformation and transduction; more recently, membrane vesicles (MVs) have been reported as DNA reservoirs implicated in interspecies HGT. Here, we review the current knowledge on the HGT mechanisms with a focus on the role of MVs and the methodological innovations in the HGT research.},

 abstract = {Integrons, genetic elements known to be involved in the adaptation of pathogenic bacteria, were first discovered in the clinical setting. However, they are ancient structures found in various environments. When clinical integrons have a low diversity, with three integrases and gene cassettes essentially encoding antibiotic resistance, in natural environments, integrons show a greater diversity, of both gene cassettes and integrases. Although a large number of gene cassettes from environmental samples have been identified, integrase diversity remains poorly documented, and has not yet been investigated in freshwater environments. The work presented here explores environmental integrons in sediments from a freshwater environment, with emphasis on integrases. Integron diversity in bacterial communities was analyzed at sampling stations with different contamination levels and contaminant types. A total of 684 integrase sequences were obtained and grouped into 322 previously undescribed integron classes, revealing a diversity wider than that previously expected in non-clinical environments. The bacterial community structures did not fully explain the integron diversity suggesting that integrase diversity could be influenced by contamination level, and that contaminant type could influence gene cassette diversity. These results provide further arguments for the involvement of integrons in the adaptation of bacterial communities in response to contaminants in natural environments.},

Here, we study the population structure and dynamics of over 10,000 bacterial plasmids, by quantifying their genetic similarities and reconstructing a network based on their shared k-mer content. We use a community detection algorithm to assign plasmids into cliques, which correlate with plasmid gene content, bacterial host range, GC content, and existing classifications based on replicon and mobility (MOB) types. Further analysis of plasmid population structure allows us to uncover candidates for yet undescribed replicon genes, and to identify transposable elements as the main drivers of HGT at broad phylogenetic scales. Our work illustrates the potential of network-based analyses of the bacterial 'mobilome' and opens up the prospect of a natural, exhaustive classification framework for bacterial plasmids.},

Despite recent discovery and characterization of the healthy urinary microbiota, stent-associated bacteria and their impact on encrustation are largely underexplored. We proﬁle the microbiota of patients with typical short-term stents, as well as over 30 atypical cases (all with paired mid-stream urine) from 241 patients. Indwelling time, age, and various patient comorbidities correlate with alterations to the stent microbiota composition, whereas antibiotic exposure, urinary tract infection (UTI), and stent placement method do not. The stent microbiota most likely originates from adhesion of resident urinary microbes but subsequently diverges to a distinct, reproducible population, thereby negating the urine as a biomarker for stent encrustation or microbiota. Urological practice should reconsider standalone prophylactic antibiotics in favor of tailored therapies based on patient comorbidities in efforts to minimize bacterial burden, encrustation, and complications of ureteral stents.},

 abstract = {Reference genomes are required to understand the diverse roles of microorganisms in ecology, evolution, human and animal health, but most species remain uncultured. Here we present a sequence composition-independent approach to recover high-quality microbial genomes from deeply sequenced metagenomes. Multiple metagenomes of the same community, which differ in relative population abundances, were used to assemble 31 bacterial genomes, including rare ({\textless}1{\%} relative abundance) species, from an activated sludge bioreactor. Twelve genomes were assembled into complete or near-complete chromosomes. Four belong to the candidate bacterial phylum TM7 and represent the most complete genomes for this phylum to date (relative abundances, 0.06-1.58{\%}). Reanalysis of published metagenomes reveals that differential coverage binning facilitates recovery of more complete and higher fidelity genome bins than other currently used methods, which are primarily based on sequence composition. This approach will be an important addition to the standard metagenome toolbox and greatly improve access to genomes of uncultured microorganisms.},

CARD focuses on providing high-quality reference data and molecular sequences within a controlled vocabulary, the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), designed by the CARD biocuration team to integrate with software development efforts for resistome analysis and prediction, such as CARD's Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) software. Since 2017, CARD has expanded through extensive curation of reference sequences, revision of the ontological structure, curation of over 500 new AMR detection models, development of a new classification paradigm and expansion of analytical tools. Most notably, a new Resistomes {\&} Variants module provides analysis and statistical summary of in silico predicted resistance variants from 82 pathogens and over 100 000 genomes. By adding these resistance variants to CARD, we are able to summarize predicted resistance using the information included in CARD, identify trends in AMR mobility and determine previously undescribed and novel resistance variants. Here, we describe updates and recent expansions to CARD and its biocuration process, including new resources for community biocuration of AMR molecular reference data.},

@article{Alderliesten.2020,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Conjugation plays a major role in the transmission of plasmids encoding antibiotic resistance genes in both clinical and general settings. The conjugation efficiency is influenced by many biotic and abiotic factors, one of which is the taxonomic relatedness between donor and recipient bacteria. A comprehensive overview of the influence of donor-recipient relatedness on conjugation is still lacking, but such an overview is important to quantitatively assess the risk of plasmid transfer and the effect of interventions which limit the spread of antibiotic resistance, and to obtain parameter values for conjugation in mathematical models. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis on reported conjugation frequencies from Escherichia coli donors to various recipient species.

RESULTS

Thirty-two studies reporting 313 conjugation frequencies for liquid broth matings and 270 conjugation frequencies for filter matings were included in our meta-analysis. The reported conjugation frequencies varied over 11 orders of magnitude. Decreasing taxonomic relatedness between donor and recipient bacteria, when adjusted for confounding factors, was associated with a lower conjugation frequency in liquid matings. The mean conjugation frequency for bacteria of the same order, the same class, and other classes was 10, 20, and 789 times lower than the mean conjugation frequency within the same species, respectively. This association between relatedness and conjugation frequency was not found for filter matings. The conjugation frequency was furthermore found to be influenced by temperature in both types of mating experiments, and in addition by plasmid incompatibility group in liquid matings, and by recipient origin and mating time in filter matings.

CONCLUSIONS

In our meta-analysis, taxonomic relatedness is limiting conjugation in liquid matings, but not in filter matings, suggesting that taxonomic relatedness is not a limiting factor for conjugation in environments where bacteria are fixed in space.},

 abstract = {Integrons are hot spots for acquiring gene cassettes from the environment and play a major role in the bacterial evolution and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), thus posing a serious threat. There are currently studies on integrons and antibiotic resistance genes; however, the presence and association of integrons in different agricultural crops and their subsequent dissemination and role in AMR have not been reported previously. This study examines the abundance of integrons, their gene cassette diversity in various crop soils, and their role in the dissemination of AMR in the southern region of China. Samples from different agri-crop soil, such as rice (R.S), sugarcane (S.S), citrus (C.S), banana (B.S), agricultural runoff (the point where the runoff of all sites meet (R.O)), and wild (non-agricultural) soil (W.S), were collected. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the abundance of integrons, and clone libraries were constructed to examine the gene cassette arrays. All the tested samples were found positive for Class-I (CL1) integrons and revealed a higher concentration and higher relative abundance of R.S than the others, with the least found at the W.S site. The W.S CL1 cassette arrays were found empty, and no putative conserved domains were found. The R.O was found to contain a high number of gene cassettes with various functions, while the smallest number of gene cassettes was found in the S.S among the crop soils. Most of the gene cassettes presented by the R.O were primarily shared with other sites, and the antibiotic-resistant genes were consistently observed to be dominant. The constructed clone libraries represented a diverse gene cassette array with 16{\%} novel gene cassettes that play a vital role in pathogenesis, transportation, biosynthesis, and AMR. Most resistance-related gene cassettes were associated with the genes encoding resistance to quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) and aminoglycosides. This study highlights the significant differences in the abundance of integrons among various agricultural soils and offers deep insight into the pools of gene cassettes that play a key role in the dissemination of integrons and AMR.},

 abstract = {Despite the threat posed by antibiotic resistance in infectious bacteria, little is known about the diversity, distribution and origins of resistance genes, particularly among the as yet unculturable environmental bacteria. One potentially rich but largely unstudied environmental reservoir is soil. The complexity of its microbial community coupled with its high density of antibiotic-producing bacteria makes the soil a likely origin for diverse antibiotic resistance determinants. To investigate antibiotic resistance genes among uncultured bacteria in an undisturbed soil environment, we undertook a functional metagenomic analysis of a remote Alaskan soil. We report that this soil is a reservoir for beta-lactamases that function in Escherichia coli, including divergent beta-lactamases and the first bifunctional beta-lactamase. Our findings suggest that even in the absence of selective pressure imposed by anthropogenic activity, the soil microbial community in an unpolluted site harbors unique and ancient beta-lactam resistance determinants. Moreover, despite their evolutionary distance from previously known genes, the Alaskan beta-lactamases confer resistance on E. coli without manipulating its gene expression machinery, demonstrating the potential for soil resistance genes to compromise human health, if transferred to pathogens.},

We recently showed that the emerging macrolide resistance in the soilborne equine and zoonotic pathogen Rhodococcus equi is conferred by the erm(46) gene carried on the 87-kb conjugative plasmid pRErm46. Here, we investigated the conjugal transferability of pRErm46 to 14 representative bacteria likely encountered by R. equi in the environmental habitat. In vitro mating experiments demonstrated conjugation to different members of the genus Rhodococcus as well as to Nocardia and Arthrobacter spp. at frequencies ranging from $\sim$10-2 to 10-6 pRErm46 transfer was also observed in mating experiments in soil and horse manure, albeit at a low frequency and after prolonged incubation at 22 to 30°C (environmental temperatures), not 37°C. All transconjugants were able to transfer pRErm46 back to R. equi Conjugation could not be detected with Mycobacterium or Corynebacterium spp. or several members of the more distant phylum Firmicutes such as Enterococcus, Streptococcus, or Staphylococcus Thus, the pRErm46 host range appears to span several actinobacterial orders with certain host restriction within the Corynebacteriales All bacterial species that acquired pRErm46 expressed increased macrolide resistance with no significant deleterious impact on fitness, except in the case of Rhodococcus rhodnii Our results indicate that actinobacterial members of the environmental microbiota can both acquire and transmit the R. equi pRErm46 plasmid and thus potentially contribute to the maintenance and spread of erm(46)-mediated macrolide resistance in equine farms.IMPORTANCE This study demonstrates the efficient horizontal transfer of the Rhodococcus equi conjugative plasmid pRErm46, recently identified as the cause of the emerging macrolide resistance among equine isolates of this pathogen, to and from different environmental Actinobacteria, including a variety of rhodococci as well as Nocardia and Arthrobacter spp. The reported data support the notion that environmental microbiotas may act as reservoirs for the endemic maintenance of antimicrobial resistance in an antibiotic pressurized farm habitat.},

 abstract = {The occurrence of chemical and biological contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) was investigated in treated wastewater intended for reuse in agriculture. An agarose hydrogel diffusion-based passive sampler was exposed to the outlet of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) located in Cyprus, which is equipped with membrane bioreactor (MBR). Passive samplers in triplicate were exposed according to a time-series exposure plan with maximum exposure duration of 28~days. Composite flow-proportional wastewater samples were collected in parallel with the passive sampling exposure plan and were processed by solid phase extraction using HORIZON SPE-DEX 4790 and the same sorbent material (Oasis HLB) as in the passive sampler. The analysis of passive samplers and wastewater samples enabled (i) the field-scale calibration of the passive sampler prototype by the calculation of in situ sampling rates of target substances, and (ii) the investigation of in silico predicted transformation products of the four most ecotoxicologically hazardous antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, ofloxacin). Additionally, the wastewater samples were subjected to the analysis of seven preselected antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and one mobile resistant element (int1). All extracts were analyzed for chemicals in a single batch using a highly sensitive method for pharmaceuticals, antibiotics and illicit drugs by liquid chromatography tandem MS/MS (LC-QQQ) and for various other target compounds (2316 compounds in total) by liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). 279 CECs and all investigated ARGs (except for blaCTX-M-32) were detected, highlighting potential chemical and biological hazards related to wastewater reuse practices. 16 CECs were prioritized following ecotoxicological risk assessment, whereas sul1 and the mobile resistant element (int1) showed the highest abundance. Comprehensive monitoring efforts using novel sampling methods such as passive sampling, wide-scope target screening and molecular analysis are required to assure safe application of wastewater reuse and avoid spread and crop uptake of potentially hazardous chemicals.},

The main aim of this review is to give a brief account of the occurrence and diversity of MGEs in natural ecosystems and of the environmental factors that may affect MGE-mediated HGT.},

 abstract = {Anthropogenic inputs increase levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the environment, however, it is unknown how these inputs create this observed increase, and if anthropogenic sources impact AMR in environmental bacteria. The aim of this study was to characterise the role of waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) in the dissemination of class 1 integrons (CL1s) in the riverine environment. Using sample sites from upstream and downstream of a WWTP, we demonstrate through isolation and culture-independent analysis that WWTP effluent significantly increases both CL1 abundance and antibiotic resistance in the riverine environment. Characterisation of CL1-bearing isolates revealed that CL1s were distributed across a diverse range of bacteria, with identical complex genetic resistance determinants isolated from both human-associated and common environmental bacteria across connected sites. Over half of sequenced CL1s lacked the 3'-conserved sequence ('atypical' CL1s); surprisingly, bacteria carrying atypical CL1s were on average resistant to more antibiotics than bacteria carrying 3'-CS CL1s. Quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) resistance genes were observed across 75{\%} of sequenced CL1 gene cassette arrays. Chemical data analysis indicated high levels of boron (a detergent marker) downstream of the WWTP. Subsequent phenotypic screening of CL1-bearing isolates demonstrated that {\~{}}90{\%} were resistant to QAC detergents, with in vitro experiments demonstrating that QACs could solely select for the transfer of clinical antibiotic resistance genes to a naive Escherichia coli recipient. In conclusion, this study highlights the significant impact of WWTPs on environmental AMR, and demonstrates the widespread carriage of clinically important resistance determinants by environmentally associated bacteria.},

 abstract = {Antibiotic heteroresistance is a phenotype in which a bacterial isolate contains subpopulations of cells that show a substantial reduction in antibiotic susceptibility compared with the main population. Recent work indicates that heteroresistance is very common for several different bacterial species and antibiotic classes. The resistance phenotype is often unstable, and in the absence of antibiotic pressure it rapidly reverts to susceptibility. A common mechanistic explanation for the instability is the occurrence of genetically unstable tandem amplifications of genes that cause resistance. Due to their instability, low frequency and transient character, it is challenging to detect and study these subpopulations, which often leads to difficulties in unambiguously classifying bacteria as susceptible or resistant. Finally, in vitro experiments, mathematical modelling, animal infection models and clinical studies show that the~resistant subpopulations can be enriched during antibiotic exposure, and increasing evidence suggests that heteroresistance can lead to treatment failure.},

To assess whether identified multi-resistant isolates are able to construct biofilms, several biofilm formation and conjugation experiments were conducted. Out of 35 isolates, six strains were used for filter mating experiments. Nine strains were identified by 16S rDNA gene sequence analyses and those were closely related to Pseudomonas sp., Citrobacter sp., Acinetobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., and in addition, Bacillus cereus was chosen for multi-resistant and pesticide-tolerant studies. Antibiotic-resistant and pesticide-tolerant bacterial strains were tested for the presence of ARGs. All nine strains were containing multiple ARGs (ampC, ermB, ermD, ermG, mecA, tetM) in different combinations. Interestingly, only strain WR34 (strongly related to Bacillus cereus) exhibited a high biofilm forming capacity on glass beads. Results obtained by filter mating experiments demonstrated gene transfer frequencies from 10(-5) to 10(-8). This study provides evidence that alluvial soils are hot spots for the accumulation of antibiotics, pesticides and biofilm formation. Particularly high resistances to tetracycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin and methicillin were proved. Apparently, isolate WR34 strongly correlated to a pathogenic organism had high potential to deploy biofilms in alluvial soils. Thus, we assume that loosened and unconsolidated soils investigated pose a high risk of an enhanced ARG prevalence.},

 abstract = {MOTIVATION

Recent advances in single molecule real-time (SMRT) and nanopore sequencing technologies have enabled high-quality assemblies from long and inaccurate reads. However, these approaches require high coverage by long reads and remain expensive. On the other hand, the inexpensive short reads technologies produce accurate but fragmented assemblies. Thus, a hybrid approach that assembles long reads (with low coverage) and short reads has a potential to generate high-quality assemblies at reduced cost.

RESULTS

We describe hybridSPAdes algorithm for assembling short and long reads and benchmark it on a variety of bacterial assembly projects. Our results demonstrate that hybridSPAdes generates accurate assemblies (even in projects with relatively low coverage by long reads) thus reducing the overall cost of genome sequencing. We further present the first complete assembly of a genome from single cells using SMRT reads.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION

hybridSPAdes is implemented in C++ as a part of SPAdes genome assembler and is publicly available at http://bioinf.spbau.ru/en/spades

@article{ArangoArgoty.2018b,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Growing concerns about increasing rates of antibiotic resistance call for expanded and comprehensive global monitoring. Advancing methods for monitoring of environmental media (e.g., wastewater, agricultural waste, food, and water) is especially needed for identifying potential resources of novel antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), hot spots for gene exchange, and as pathways for the spread of ARGs and human exposure. Next-generation sequencing now enables direct access and profiling of the total metagenomic DNA pool, where ARGs are typically identified or predicted based on the {\textquotedbl}best hits{\textquotedbl} of sequence searches against existing databases. Unfortunately, this approach produces a high rate of false negatives. To address such limitations, we propose here a deep learning approach, taking into account a dissimilarity matrix created using all known categories of ARGs. Two deep learning models, DeepARG-SS and DeepARG-LS, were constructed for short read sequences and full gene length sequences, respectively.

RESULTS

Evaluation of the deep learning models over 30 antibiotic resistance categories demonstrates that the DeepARG models can predict ARGs with both high precision ({\textgreater} 0.97) and recall ({\textgreater} 0.90). The models displayed an advantage over the typical best hit approach, yielding consistently lower false negative rates and thus higher overall recall ({\textgreater} 0.9). As more data become available for under-represented ARG categories, the DeepARG models' performance can be expected to be further enhanced due to the nature of the underlying neural networks. Our newly developed ARG database, DeepARG-DB, encompasses ARGs predicted with a high degree of confidence and extensive manual inspection, greatly expanding current ARG repositories.

CONCLUSIONS

The deep learning models developed here offer more accurate antimicrobial resistance annotation relative to current bioinformatics practice. DeepARG does not require strict cutoffs, which enables identification of a much broader diversity of ARGs. The DeepARG models and database are available as a command line version and as a Web service at http://bench.cs.vt.edu/deeparg .},

The biofilm is a promising indicator to evaluate the impacts of WWTPs on the surrounding aquatic environment. Indeed, the use of biofilms reveals contamination hot spots. All of the downstream biofilms present significant concentrations (up to 965ng/g) of five to 11 pharmaceuticals (among the 12 analysed). Moreover, the exposition to the discharge point increases the presence of resistance integrons (three to 31 fold for Class 1) and modifies the diversity of the bacterial communities (for example cyanobacteria).

Many commensal and pathogenic organisms have developed resistance to well established and newer antibiotics. The major selection pressure driving changes in the frequency of antibiotic resistance is the volume of drug use. However, establishing a quantitative relationship between the frequency of resistance and volume of drug use has proved difficult. Using population genetic methods and epidemiological observations, we report an analysis of the influence of the selective pressure imposed by the volume of drug use on temporal changes in resistance. Analytical expressions are derived to delineate key relationships between resistance and drug consumption. The analyses indicate that the time scale for emergence of resistance under a constant selective pressure is typically much shorter than the decay time after cessation or decline in the volume of drug use and that significant reductions in resistance require equally significant reductions in drug consumption. These results highlight the need for early intervention once resistance is detected.},

We show that shrinkage estimation, a standard technique in high-dimensional statistics, can universally improve the quality of association estimates for microbiome data. We ﬁnd that large-scale association patterns in the AGP data can be grouped into ﬁve normalization-dependent classes.

Conjugative elements have been instrumental in many bacterial species to face the threat of antibiotics, by allowing them to evolve and adapt to these hostile conditions. Conjugative plasmids are transferred to plasmidless recipient cells as single-stranded DNA. We used lacZ and gfp fusions to address whether conjugation induces the SOS response and the integron integrase. The SOS response controls a series of genes responsible for DNA damage repair, which can lead to recombination and mutagenesis. In this manuscript, we show that conjugative transfer of ssDNA induces the bacterial SOS stress response, unless an anti-SOS factor is present to alleviate this response. We also show that integron integrases are up-regulated during this process, resulting in increased cassette rearrangements. Moreover, the data we obtained using broad and narrow host range plasmids strongly suggests that plasmid transfer, even abortive, can trigger chromosomal gene rearrangements and transcriptional switches in the recipient cell. Our results highlight the importance of environments concentrating disparate bacterial communities as reactors for extensive genetic adaptation of bacteria.},

 abstract = {The taxonomic position of a Gram-stain negative, non-violaceinpigmented bacterium isolated from an insecticide-contaminated site was characterized by a polyphasic approach. The bacterium was able to grow on three different halogenated compounds namely 1-hlorobutane, 1-hloropropane and 1,2-ichloroethane. As a critical step in the degradation of these haloalkanes, stoichiometric amounts of dechlorination were estimated. Based on selective enrichment method for three months, using a highly contaminated mixed chemical soil, a bacterium was obtained and designated as IITR-71T. Its versatility and novelty led us to further characterize it by polyphasic taxonomy. The 16S rRNA gene sequence (1446 bases) comparison showed highest similarity with those of members of the genus Chromobacterium with the most closely related species to strain IITR-71T being Chromobacterium aquaticum (99.3 {\%}) followed by Chromobacterium haemolyticum (98.6 {\%}) and Chromobacterium piscinae (97.1 {\%}). The major ubiquinone was Q-8. Predominant polar lipids are phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG). The DNA G+C content of IITR-71T was estimated to be 61.2 mol{\%}. The genotypic and phenotypic distinctiveness of IITR-71T and its phylogenetic relationships indicate that IITR-71T represents a novel species, for which the name Chromobacterium alkanivorans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IITR-71T (=MTCC 11059T=JCM 30068T=KCTC 52433T).},

Documented associations between the types and levels of metal contamination and specific patterns of antibiotic resistance suggest that several mechanisms underlie this co-selection process. These co-selection mechanisms include co-resistance (different resistance determinants present on the same genetic element) and cross-resistance (the same genetic determinant responsible for resistance to antibiotics and metals). Indirect but shared regulatory responses to metal and antibiotic exposure such as biofilm induction also represent potential co-selection mechanisms used by prokaryotes. Metal contamination, therefore, represents a long-standing, widespread and recalcitrant selection pressure with both environmental and clinical importance that potentially contributes to the maintenance and spread of antibiotic resistance factors.},

However, there is increasing evidence that bacterial antibiotic persistence, a non-genetically encoded and reversible loss of antibiotic susceptibility, contributes to treatment failure and emergence of resistant strains as well. In this Review, we discuss the evolutionary forces that may drive the selection for antibiotic persistence. We review how some aspects of antibiotic persistence have been directly selected for whereas others result from indirect selection in disparate ecological contexts. We then discuss the consequences of antibiotic persistence on pathogen evolution. Persisters can facilitate the evolution of antibiotic resistance and virulence. Finally, we propose practical means to prevent persister formation and how this may help to slow down the evolution of virulence and resistance in pathogens.},

 abstract = {MOTIVATION

The microbes that live in an environment can be identified from the combined genomic material, also referred to as the metagenome. Sequencing a metagenome can result in large volumes of sequencing reads. A promising approach to reduce the size of metagenomic datasets is by clustering reads into groups based on their overlaps. Clustering reads are valuable to facilitate downstream analyses, including computationally intensive strain-aware assembly. As current read clustering approaches cannot handle the large datasets arising from high-throughput metagenome sequencing, a novel read clustering approach is needed. In this article, we propose OGRE, an Overlap Graph-based Read clustEring procedure for high-throughput sequencing data, with a focus on shotgun metagenomes.

RESULTS

We show that for small datasets OGRE outperforms other read binners in terms of the number of species included in a cluster, also referred to as cluster purity, and the fraction of all reads that is placed in one of the clusters. Furthermore, OGRE is able to process metagenomic datasets that are too large for other read binners into clusters with high cluster purity.

CONCLUSION

OGRE is the only method that can successfully cluster reads in species-specific clusters for large metagenomic datasets without running into computation time- or memory issues.

Using agroforestry systems as a model, this study examined the effects of land uses and edaphic properties on bacterial communities in three agroforestry types covering a 270 km soil-climate gradient in Alberta, Canada. Our results demonstrate that land-use patterns exert stronger effects on soil bacterial communities than soil zones in these agroforestry systems. Plots with trees in agroforestry systems promoted greater bacterial abundance and to some extent species richness, which was associated with more nutrient-rich soil resources. While Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla and subphyla across land uses, Arthrobacter, Acidobacteria{\_}Gp16, Burkholderia, Rhodanobacter and Rhizobium were the keystone taxa in these agroforestry systems. Soil pH and carbon contents emerged as the major determinants of bacterial community characteristics. We found non-random co-occurrence and modular patterns of soil bacterial communities, and these patterns were controlled by edaphic factors and not their taxonomy. Overall, this study highlights the drivers and co-occurrence patterns of soil microbial communities in agroforestry systems.},

Descriptions of the evolution of microorganisms have provided a wealth of information, but knowledge regarding {\textquotedbl}what happened{\textquotedbl} has precluded a deeper understanding of {\textquotedbl}how{\textquotedbl} evolution has proceeded, as in the case of antimicrobial resistance. The difficulty in answering the {\textquotedbl}how{\textquotedbl} question lies in the multihierarchical dimensions of evolutionary processes, nested in complex networks, encompassing all units of selection, from genes to communities and ecosystems. At the simplest ontological level (as resistance genes), evolution proceeds by random (mutation and drift) and directional (natural selection) processes; however, sequential pathways of adaptive variation can occasionally be observed, and under fixed circumstances (particular fitness landscapes), evolution is predictable. At the highest level (such as that of plasmids, clones, species, microbiotas), the systems' degrees of freedom increase dramatically, related to the variable dispersal, fragmentation, relatedness, or coalescence of bacterial populations, depending on heterogeneous and changing niches and selective gradients in complex environments. Evolutionary trajectories of antibiotic resistance find their way in these changing landscapes subjected to random variations, becoming highly entropic and therefore unpredictable. However, experimental, phylogenetic, and ecogenetic analyses reveal preferential frequented paths (highways) where antibiotic resistance flows and propagates, allowing some understanding of evolutionary dynamics, modeling and designing interventions. Studies on antibiotic resistance have an applied aspect in improving individual health, One Health, and Global Health, as well as an academic value for understanding evolution. Most importantly, they have a heuristic significance as a model to reduce the negative influence of anthropogenic effects on the environment.},

Persister tolerance is generally attributed to minimally active cellular processes that prevent antibiotic-induced damage, which has led to the supposition that persister offspring give rise to antibiotic-resistant mutants at comparable rates to normal cells. Using time-lapse microscopy to monitor Escherichia coli populations following ofloxacin treatment, we find that persisters filament extensively and induce impressive SOS responses before returning to a normal appearance. Further, populations derived from fluoroquinolone persisters contain significantly greater quantities of antibiotic-resistant mutants than those from untreated controls. We confirm that resistance is heritable and that the enhancement requires RecA, SOS induction, an opportunity to recover from treatment, and the involvement of error-prone DNA polymerase V (UmuDC). These findings show that fluoroquinolones damage DNA in persisters and that the ensuing SOS response accelerates the development of antibiotic resistance from these survivors.},

However, unlike plant communities, little is known about how the diversity and biomass of soil microbial communities are interlinked across globally distributed biomes, and how variations in this relationship influence ecosystem function. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a field survey across global biomes, with contrasting vegetation and climate types. We show that soil carbon (C) content is associated to the microbial diversity-biomass relationship and ratio in soils across global biomes. This ratio provides an integrative index to identify those locations on Earth wherein diversity is much higher compared with biomass and vice versa. The soil microbial diversity-to-biomass ratio peaks in arid environments with low C content, and is very low in C-rich cold environments. Our study further advances that the reductions in soil C content associated with land use intensification and climate change could cause dramatic shifts in the microbial diversity-biomass ratio, with potential consequences for broad soil processes.},

Environmental and genetic factors that regulate conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial populations are largely unknown. Integrating conjugative elements (ICEs) are a diverse group of mobile elements that are transferred by means of cell-cell contact and integrate into the chromosome of the new host. SXT is a approximately 100-kilobase ICE derived from Vibrio cholerae that encodes genes that confer resistance to chloramphenicol, sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim and streptomycin. SXT-related elements were not detected in V. cholerae before 1993 but are now present in almost all clinical V. cholerae isolates from Asia. ICEs related to SXT are also present in several other bacterial species and encode a variety of antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes. Here we show that SetR, an SXT encoded repressor, represses the expression of activators of SXT transfer. The 'SOS response' to DNA damage alleviates this repression, increasing the expression of genes necessary for SXT transfer and hence the frequency of transfer. SOS is induced by a variety of environmental factors and antibiotics, for example ciprofloxacin, and we show that ciprofloxacin induces SXT transfer as well. Thus, we present a mechanism by which therapeutic agents can promote the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.},

 abstract = {The ribosomal rRNA genes are widely used as genetic markers for taxonomic identification of microbes. Particularly the small subunit (SSU; 16S/18S) rRNA gene is frequently used for species- or genus-level identification, but also the large subunit (LSU; 23S/28S) rRNA gene is employed in taxonomic assignment. The METAXA software tool is a popular utility for extracting partial rRNA sequences from large sequencing data sets and assigning them to an archaeal, bacterial, nuclear eukaryote, mitochondrial or chloroplast origin. This study describes a comprehensive update to METAXA - METAXA2 - that extends the capabilities of the tool, introducing support for the LSU rRNA gene, a greatly improved classifier allowing classification down to genus or species level, as well as enhanced support for short-read (100 bp) and paired-end sequences, among other changes. The performance of METAXA2 was compared to other commonly used taxonomic classifiers, showing that METAXA2 often outperforms previous methods in terms of making correct predictions while maintaining a low misclassification rate.

 abstract = {There are concerns that selection pressure from antibiotics in the environment may accelerate the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Nevertheless, there is currently no regulatory system that takes such risks into account. In part, this is due to limited knowledge of environmental concentrations that might exert selection for resistant bacteria. To experimentally determine minimal selective concentrations in complex microbial ecosystems for all antibiotics would involve considerable effort. In this work, our aim was to estimate upper boundaries for selective concentrations for all common antibiotics, based on the assumption that selective concentrations a priori need to be lower than those completely inhibiting growth. Data on Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were obtained for 111 antibiotics from the public EUCAST database. The 1{\%} lowest observed MICs were identified, and to compensate for limited species coverage, predicted lowest MICs adjusted for the number of tested species were extrapolated through modeling. Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNECs) for resistance selection were then assessed using an assessment factor of 10 to account for differences between MICs and minimal selective concentrations. The resulting PNECs ranged from 8 ng/L to 64 \textgreek{m}g/L. Furthermore, the link between taxonomic similarity between species and lowest MIC was weak. This work provides estimated upper boundaries for selective concentrations (lowest MICs) and PNECs for resistance selection for all common antibiotics. In most cases, PNECs for selection of resistance were below available PNECs for ecotoxicological effects. The generated PNECs can guide implementation of compound-specific emission limits that take into account risks for resistance promotion.},

Recent research points to the environment as an important component for the transmission of resistant bacteria and in the emergence of resistant pathogens. However, a deeper understanding of the evolutionary and ecological processes that lead to clinical appearance of resistance genes is still lacking, as is knowledge of environmental dispersal barriers. This calls for better models of how resistance genes evolve, are mobilized, transferred and disseminated in the environment. Here, we attempt to define the ecological and evolutionary environmental factors that contribute to resistance development and transmission. Although mobilization of resistance genes likely occurs continuously, the great majority of such genetic events do not lead to the establishment of novel resistance factors in bacterial populations, unless there is a selection pressure for maintaining them or their fitness costs are negligible. To enable preventative measures it is therefore critical to investigate under what conditions and to what extent environmental selection for resistance takes place. In addition, understanding dispersal barriers is not only key to evaluate risks, but also to prevent resistant pathogens, as well as novel resistance genes, from reaching humans.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The miniaturised and portable DNA sequencer MinION{\texttrademark} has been released to the scientific community within the framework of an early access programme to evaluate its application for a wide variety of genetic approaches. This technology has demonstrated great potential, especially in genome-wide analyses. In this study, we tested the ability of the MinION{\texttrademark} system to perform amplicon sequencing in order to design new approaches to study microbial diversity using nearly full-length 16S rDNA sequences.

RESULTS

Using R7.3 chemistry, we generated more than 3.8 million events (nt) during a single sequencing run. These data were sufficient to reconstruct more than 90~{\%} of the 16S rRNA gene sequences for 20 different species present in a mock reference community. After read mapping and 16S rRNA gene assembly, consensus sequences and 2d reads were recovered to assign taxonomic classification down to the species level. Additionally, we were able to measure the relative abundance of all the species present in a mock community and detected a biased species distribution originating from the PCR reaction using 'universal' primers.

CONCLUSIONS

Although nanopore-based sequencing produces reads with lower per-base accuracy compared with other platforms, the MinION{\texttrademark} DNA sequencer is valuable for both high taxonomic resolution and microbial diversity analysis. Improvements in nanopore chemistry, such as minimising base-calling errors and the nucleotide bias reported here for 16S amplicon sequencing, will further deliver more reliable information that is useful for the specific detection of microbial species and strains in complex ecosystems.},

After compiling a robust database by parsing and extracting the rrn bacterial region from more than 67000 complete or draft bacterial genomes, we demonstrated that the data obtained during sequencing of the long amplicon in the MinION{\texttrademark} device using R9 and R9.4 chemistries were sufficient to study 2 mock microbial communities in a multiplex manner and to almost completely reconstruct the microbial diversity contained in the HM782D and D6305 mock communities.

Indoor environments contain microbes from both human and non-human origins, providing a unique venue for microbial interactions, including horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, stressors present in the built environment could favor the exchange of genetic material in general and the retention of antibiotic resistance genes in particular. Intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance both pose a potential threat to human health; these phenomena need to be considered and controlled separately.

There are concerns that the widespread use of antimicrobials in the food chain constitutes an important source of AMR in humans, but the extent of this transmission is not well understood. The aim of this review is to examine published evidence on the links between antimicrobial use (AMU) in the food chain and AMR in people and animals. The evidence showed a link between AMU in animals and the occurrence of resistance in these animals. However, evidence of the benefits of a reduction in AMU in animals on the prevalence of resistant bacteria in humans is scarce. The presence of resistant bacteria is documented in the human food supply chain, which presents a potential exposure route and risk to public health. Microbial genome sequencing has enabled the establishment of some links between the presence of resistant bacteria in humans and animals but, for some antimicrobials, no link could be established. Research and monitoring of AMU and AMR in an integrated manner is essential for a better understanding of the biology and the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance.},

 abstract = {Members of the Chromobacterium genus include opportunistic but often-fatal pathogens and soil saprophytes with highly versatile metabolic capabilities. In previous studies of Chromobacterium subtsugae (formerly C. violaceum) strain CV017, we identified a resistance nodulation division (RND)-family efflux pump (CdeAB-OprM) that confers resistance to several antibiotics, including the bactobolin antibiotic produced by the soil saprophyte Burkholderia thailandensis Here, we show the cdeAB-oprM genes increase C. subtsugae survival in a laboratory competition model with B. thailandensis We also demonstrate that adding sublethal bactobolin concentrations to the coculture increases C. subtsugae survival, but this effect is not through CdeAB-OprM. Instead, the increased survival requires a second, previously unreported pump we call CseAB-OprN. We show that in cells exposed to sublethal bactobolin concentrations, the cseAB-oprN genes are transcriptionally induced, and this corresponds to an increase in bactobolin resistance. Induction of this pump is highly specific and sensitive to bactobolin, while CdeAB-OprM appears to have a broader range of antibiotic recognition. We examine the distribution of cseAB-oprN and cdeAB-oprM gene clusters in members of the Chromobacterium genus and find the cseAB-oprN genes are limited to the nonpathogenic C. subtsugae strains, whereas the cdeAB-oprM genes are more widely distributed among members of the Chromobacterium genus. Our results provide new information on the antibiotic resistance mechanisms of Chromobacterium species and highlight the importance of efflux pumps for saprophytic bacteria existing in multispecies communities.IMPORTANCE Antibiotic efflux pumps are best known for increasing antibiotic resistance of pathogens; however, the role of these pumps in saprophytes is much less well defined. This study describes two predicted efflux pump gene clusters in the Chromobacterium genus, which is comprised of both nonpathogenic saprophytes and species that cause highly fatal human infections. One of the predicted efflux pump clusters is present in every member of the Chromobacterium genus and increases resistance to a broad range of antibiotics. The other gene cluster has more narrow antibiotic specificity and is found only in Chromobacterium subtsugae, a subset of entirely nonpathogenic species. We demonstrate the role of both pumps in increasing antibiotic resistance and demonstrate the importance of efflux-dependent resistance induction for C. subtsugae survival in a dual-species competition model. These results have implications for managing antibiotic-resistant Chromobacterium infections and for understanding the evolution of efflux pumps outside the host.},

 abstract = {A significant 19th century public health problem was that the inhabitants of many houses containing wallpaper decorated with green arsenical pigments experienced illness and death. The problem was caused by certain fungi that grew in the presence of inorganic arsenic to form a toxic, garlic-odored gas. The garlic odor was actually put to use in a very delicate microbiological test for arsenic. In 1933, the gas was shown to be trimethylarsine. It was not until 1971 that arsenic methylation by bacteria was demonstrated. Further research in biomethylation has been facilitated by the development of delicate techniques for the determination of arsenic species. As described in this review, many microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and yeasts) and animals are now known to biomethylate arsenic, forming both volatile (e.g., methylarsines) and nonvolatile (e.g., methylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid) compounds. The enzymatic mechanisms for this biomethylation are discussed. The microbial conversion of sodium arsenate to trimethylarsine proceeds by alternate reduction and methylation steps, with S-adenosylmethionine as the usual methyl donor. Thiols have important roles in the reductions. In anaerobic bacteria, methylcobalamin may be the donor. The other metalloid elements of the periodic table group 15, antimony and bismuth, also undergo biomethylation to some extent. Trimethylstibine formation by microorganisms is now well established, but this process apparently does not occur in animals. Formation of trimethylbismuth by microorganisms has been reported in a few cases. Microbial methylation plays important roles in the biogeochemical cycling of these metalloid elements and possibly in their detoxification. The wheel has come full circle, and public health considerations are again important.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Environmental and commensal bacteria maintain a diverse and largely unknown collection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that, over time, may be mobilized and transferred to pathogens. Metagenomics enables cultivation-independent characterization of bacterial communities but the resulting data is noisy and highly fragmented, severely hampering the identification of previously undescribed ARGs. We have therefore developed fARGene, a method for identification and reconstruction of ARGs directly from shotgun metagenomic data.

RESULTS

fARGene uses optimized gene models and can therefore with high accuracy identify previously uncharacterized resistance genes, even if their sequence similarity to known ARGs is low. By performing the analysis directly on the metagenomic fragments, fARGene also circumvents the need for a high-quality assembly. To demonstrate the applicability of fARGene, we reconstructed \textgreek{b}-lactamases from five billion metagenomic reads, resulting in 221 ARGs, of which 58 were previously not reported. Based on 38 ARGs reconstructed by fARGene, experimental verification showed that 81{\%} provided a resistance phenotype in Escherichia coli. Compared to other methods for detecting ARGs in metagenomic data, fARGene has superior sensitivity and the ability to reconstruct previously unknown genes directly from the sequence reads.

CONCLUSIONS

We conclude that fARGene provides an efficient and reliable way to explore the unknown resistome in bacterial communities. The method is applicable to any type of ARGs and is freely available via GitHub under the MIT license.},

The origin of the genes associated with this resistance is of significant importance to our understanding of the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance in pathogens. A growing body of evidence implicates environmental organisms as reservoirs of these resistance genes; however, the role of anthropogenic use of antibiotics in the emergence of these genes is controversial. We report a screen of a sample of the culturable microbiome of Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico, in a region of the cave that has been isolated for over 4 million years. We report that, like surface microbes, these bacteria were highly resistant to antibiotics; some strains were resistant to 14 different commercially available antibiotics. Resistance was detected to a wide range of structurally different antibiotics including daptomycin, an antibiotic of last resort in the treatment of drug resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Enzyme-mediated mechanisms of resistance were also discovered for natural and semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotics via glycosylation and through a kinase-mediated phosphorylation mechanism. Sequencing of the genome of one of the resistant bacteria identified a macrolide kinase encoding gene and characterization of its product revealed it to be related to a known family of kinases circulating in modern drug resistant pathogens. The implications of this study are significant to our understanding of the prevalence of resistance, even in microbiomes isolated from human use of antibiotics. This supports a growing understanding that antibiotic resistance is natural, ancient, and hard wired in the microbial pangenome.},

 abstract = {Effluents from pharmaceutical industries are recognized as significant contributors to aquatic pollution with antibiotics. Although such pollution has been mostly reported in Asia, knowledge on industrial discharges in other regions of the world, including Europe, and on the effects associated with such exposures is still limited. Thus, we performed chemical, microbiological and ecotoxicological analyses of effluents from two Croatian pharmaceutical industries during four seasons. In treated effluents of the company synthesizing macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (AZI), the total concentration of AZI and two macrolide by-products from its synthesis was 1-3 orders of magnitude higher in winter and springtime (up to 10.5~mg/L) than during the other two seasons (up to 638~\textgreek{m}g/L). Accordingly, the highest total concentrations (up to 30~\textgreek{m}g/L) in the recipient river were measured in winter and spring. Effluents from second company formulating veterinary antibiotics contained fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim, sulfonamides and tetracyclines ranging from low \textgreek{m}g/L to approx. 200~\textgreek{m}g/L. Low concentrations of these antibiotics, from below the limit of quantification to approx. few \textgreek{m}g/L, have also been measured in the recipient stream. High frequency of culturable bacteria resistant to AZI (up to 83{\%}) or sulfamethazine (up to 90{\%}) and oxytetracycline (up to 50{\%}) were also found in studied effluents. Finally, we demonstrated that toxicity to algae and water fleas often exceeded the permitted values. Most highly contaminated effluents induced multiple abnormalities in zebrafish embryos. In conclusion, using a wide array of analyses we have demonstrated that discharges from pharmaceutical industries can pose a significant ecological and public health concern due to their toxicity to aquatic organisms and risks for promoting development and spread of antibiotic resistance.},

Eight pdif sites, consisting of inversely oriented binding sites for the XerC and XerD recombinases separated by 6 bp, were detected in pS30-1. The tet39 determinant and the msrE-mphE gene pair are each surrounded by two pdif sites in inverse orientation. Identical regions in different contexts and many previously unnoticed pdif sites were found in a number of different plasmids in GenBank, showing that the tet39 and msrE-mphE dif modules are mobile. A putative toxin/antitoxin system, a gene encoding a serine recombinase, and open reading frames of unknown function were also part of dif modules in pS30-1. In general, modules with internal XerC or XerD sites alternate. Two copies of ISAjo2-1 (94{\%} identical to ISAjo2) in pS30-1 were inserted 5 bp from a XerC site, and this appears to be the preferred insertion site for this insertion sequence (IS) group. Apparently, Acinetobacter plasmids exploit the Acinetobacter XerC-XerD recombinases to mobilize DNA units containing resistance and other genes, via an uncharacterized mechanism. The tet39 and msrE-mphE dif modules add to the oxa24 module and the oxa58 module redefined here, bringing the total of resistance gene-containing dif modules in Acinetobacter plasmids to four.},

Thus, their use resides at the intersection of personal and public health. Antibiotics can be likened to a four-edged sword against bacteria. The first two edges of the antibiotic sword were identified immediately after their discovery and deployment in that they not only benefit an individual in treating their infection but also benefit the community in preventing the spread of that infectious agent. The third edge was already recognized by Alexander Fleming in 1945 in his Nobel acceptance speech, which warned about the cost to the community of antibiotic resistance that would inevitably evolve and be selected for during clinical practice. We have seen this cost mount up, as resistance curtails or precludes the activities of some of our most effective drugs for clinically important infections. But the fourth edge of the antibiotic sword remained unappreciated until recently, i.e., the cost that an antibiotic exerts on an individual's own health via the collateral damage of the drug on bacteria that normally live on or in healthy humans: our microbiota. These organisms, their genes, metabolites, and interactions with one another, as well as with their host collectively, represent our microbiome. Our relationship with these symbiotic bacteria is especially important during the early years of life, when the adult microbiome has not yet formed.},

 abstract = {Artificial laboratory evolution was used to produce mutant strains of Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) able to survive on antimicrobial metallic copper surfaces. These mutants were 12- and 60-fold less susceptible to the copper-mediated contact killing process than their respective parent strains. Growth levels of the mutant and its parent in complex growth medium were similar. Tolerance to copper ions of the mutants was unchanged. The mutant phenotype remained stable over about 250 generations under nonstress conditions. The mutants and their respective parental strains accumulated copper released from the metallic surfaces to similar extents. Nevertheless, only the parental strains succumbed to copper stress when challenged on metallic copper surfaces, suffering complete destruction of the cell structure. Whole-genome sequencing and global transcriptome analysis were used to decipher the genetic alterations in the mutant strains; however, these results did not explain the copper-tolerance phenotypes on the systemic level. Instead, the mutants shared features with those of stressed bacterial subpopulations entering the early or {\textquotedbl}shallow{\textquotedbl} persister state. In contrast to the canonical persister state, however, the ability to survive on solid copper surfaces was adopted by the majority of the mutant strain population. This indicated that application of solid copper surfaces in hospitals and elsewhere has to be accompanied by strict cleaning regimens to keep the copper surfaces active and prevent evolution of tolerant mutant strains.IMPORTANCE Microbes are rapidly killed on solid copper surfaces by contact killing. Copper surfaces thus have an important role to play in preventing the spread of nosocomial infections. Bacteria adapt to challenging natural and clinical environments through evolutionary processes, for instance, by acquisition of beneficial spontaneous mutations. We wish to address the question of whether mutants can be selected that have evolved to survive contact killing on solid copper surfaces. We isolated such mutants from Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by artificial laboratory evolution. The ability to survive on solid copper surfaces was a stable phenotype of the mutant population and not restricted to a small subpopulation. As a consequence, standard operation procedures with strict hygienic measures are extremely important to prevent the emergence and spread of copper-surface-tolerant persister-like bacterial strains if copper surfaces are to be sustainably used to limit the spread of pathogenic bacteria, e.g., to curb nosocomial infections.},

It focuses on outpatient treatment of human infections and identifies a number of interventions that would be needed to achieve these policy goals.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

New antibiotic resistance determinants are generally discovered too late, long after they have irreversibly emerged in pathogens and spread widely. Early discovery of resistance genes, before or soon after their transfer to pathogens could allow more effective measures to monitor and reduce spread, and facilitate genetics-based diagnostics.

RESULTS

We modified a functional metagenomics approach followed by in silico filtering of known resistance genes to discover novel, mobilised resistance genes in class 1 integrons in wastewater-impacted environments. We identified an integron-borne gene cassette encoding a protein that conveys high-level resistance against aminoglycosides with a garosamine moiety when expressed in E. coli. The gene is named gar (garosamine-specific aminoglycoside resistance) after its specificity. It contains none of the functional domains of known aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, but bears characteristics of a kinase. By searching public databases, we found that the gene occurs in three sequenced, multi-resistant clinical isolates (two Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one Luteimonas sp.) from Italy and China, respectively, as well as in two food-borne Salmonella enterica isolates from the USA. In all cases, gar has escaped discovery until now.

CONCLUSION

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a novel resistance gene, present in clinical isolates, has been discovered by exploring the environmental microbiome. The gar gene has spread horizontally to different species on at least three continents, further limiting treatment options for bacterial infections. Its specificity to garosamine-containing aminoglycosides may reduce the usefulness of the newest semisynthetic aminoglycoside plazomicin, which is designed to avoid common aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms. Since the gene appears to be not yet common in the clinics, the data presented here enables early surveillance and maybe even mitigation of its spread.},

RESULTS

We present q2-feature-classifier ( https://github.com/qiime2/q2-feature-classifier ), a QIIME 2 plugin containing several novel machine-learning and alignment-based methods for taxonomy classification. We evaluated and optimized several commonly used classification methods implemented in QIIME 1 (RDP, BLAST, UCLUST, and SortMeRNA) and several new methods implemented in QIIME 2 (a scikit-learn naive Bayes machine-learning classifier, and alignment-based taxonomy consensus methods based on VSEARCH, and BLAST+) for classification of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS marker-gene amplicon sequence data. The naive-Bayes, BLAST+-based, and VSEARCH-based classifiers implemented in QIIME 2 meet or exceed the species-level accuracy of other commonly used methods designed for classification of marker gene sequences that were evaluated in this work.

We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data.

RESULTS

The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.

In the United States, an estimated 0.8 million cases of campylobacteriosis occur annually, mostly involving C. jejuni Campylobacteriosis is generally self-limiting, but in severe cases, treatment with antibiotics may be mandated. The increasing incidence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter has rendered macrolides such as erythromycin and azithromycin the drugs of choice for human campylobacteriosis. The prevalence of macrolide resistance in C. jejuni remains low, but macrolide resistance can be common in C. coli Substitutions in the 23S rRNA gene, specifically A2075G, and less frequently A2074C/G, remain the most common mechanism for high-level resistance to macrolides. In C. jejuni, resistance mediated by such substitutions is accompanied by a reduced ability to colonize chickens and other fitness costs, potentially contributing to the low incidence of macrolide resistance. Interestingly, similar fitness impacts have not been noted in C. coli Also noteworthy is a novel mechanism first reported in 2014 for a C. coli isolate from China and mediated by erm(B) harbored on multidrug resistance genomic islands. The incidence of erm(B) appears to reflect clonal expansion of certain strains, and whole-genome sequencing has been critical to the elucidation of erm(B)-associated macrolide resistance in Campylobacter spp. With the exception of one report from Spain, erm(B)-mediated macrolide resistance has been restricted to Campylobacter spp., mostly C. coli, of animal and human origin from China. If erm(B)-mediated macrolide resistance does not confer fitness costs in C. jejuni, the range of this gene may expand in C. jejuni, threatening to compromise treatment effectiveness for severe campylobacteriosis cases.},

@article{Booth.2020,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing public health concern. Recent research has suggested that interactions between pathogens and antibiotic residues in various environmental matrices promote the development and spread of AMR in the environment. The levels of antibiotic residues in the aquatic environment have been analysed globally. Recently, Predicted No Effect Environmental Concentration (PNEC) values for many antibiotics have been suggested, based on their estimated minimal selective concentrations for selected bacterial species. The PNEC values can serve as a guide on the maximum levels of antibiotic residues in an environmental matrix, below which resistance is unlikely to develop.

AIM

We aimed to determine which of the antibiotics, considered as {\textquotedbl}priority antibiotics{\textquotedbl} by the World Health Organisation (WHO), most frequently exceeded their PNEC values in the global aquatic environment.

METHODS

We obtained data from the German Environment Agency pharmaceutical database on means, medians or single values of 12 antibiotic types in five different environmental matrices [municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent, industrial wastewater effluent, hospital wastewater effluent, surface water, and drinking water] across 47 countries. We compared the mean levels of the 12 antibiotics in each environmental matrix to their suggested PNEC values to determine which antibiotic types exceeded PNEC and were most likely to select for resistance. We also determined which environmental matrices and countries had the highest burden of antibiotic residues.

RESULTS

Our study revealed that 7.9{\%} of all analyses of antibiotic residues performed in the environmental matrices globally exceeded PNEC. Ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin had the greatest proportion ({\textgreater}30{\%}) of residues exceeding PNEC. Hospital wastewater and industrial wastewater had the highest burden of antibiotic residues exceeding PNEC. No antibiotics exceeded PNEC in drinking water.

CONCLUSION

While most environmental monitoring studies have focused on municipal wastewater treatment plants, the limited number of studies on hospital wastewater and industrial wastewater revealed that a large number of antibiotic residues coming from these sources exceeded their PNEC values. Our study highlights the importance of implementing on-site treatment systems that aim to destroy antibiotics prior to discharging wastewater to surface waters. Attention needs to be focused on the role that environmental matrices, particularly our wastewater sites, play in promoting antibiotic resistance. Novel treatment technologies need to be developed and implemented to increase the removal efficiencies of treatment plants and from antibiotic manufacturing, and decrease the discharge of antibiotic residues into aquatic environments.},

We outline how interspecies interactions can affect the responses of individual species and communities to antibiotic treatment, and how these responses could affect the strength of selection, potentially changing the trajectory of resistance evolution. Finally, we identify key areas of future research which will allow for a more complete understanding of antibiotic resistance in bacterial communities. We emphasise that acknowledging the ecological context, i.e. the interactions that occur between pathogens and within communities, could help the development of more efficient and effective antibiotic treatments.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Over the past 10-15 years, a substantial amount of work has been done by the scientific, regulatory, and business communities to elucidate the effects and risks of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment.

OBJECTIVE

This review was undertaken to identify key outstanding issues regarding the effects of PPCPs on human and ecological health in order to ensure that future resources will be focused on the most important areas.

DATA SOURCES

To better understand and manage the risks of PPCPs in the environment, we used the {\textquotedbl}key question{\textquotedbl} approach to identify the principle issues that need to be addressed. Initially, questions were solicited from academic, government, and business communities around the world. A list of 101 questions was then discussed at an international expert workshop, and a top-20 list was developed. Following the workshop, workshop attendees ranked the 20 questions by importance.

DATA SYNTHESIS

The top 20 priority questions fell into seven categories: a) prioritization of substances for assessment, b) pathways of exposure, c) bioavailability and uptake, d) effects characterization, e) risk and relative risk, f ) antibiotic resistance, and g) risk management.

CONCLUSIONS

A large body of information is now available on PPCPs in the environment. This exercise prioritized the most critical questions to aid in development of future research programs on the topic.},

In recent years there has been an increased incidence and prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), enzymes that hydrolyze and cause resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and aztreonam. The majority of ESBLs are derived from the widespread broad-spectrum beta-lactamases TEM-1 and SHV-1. There are also new families of ESBLs, including the CTX-M and OXA-type enzymes as well as novel, unrelated beta-lactamases. Several different methods for the detection of ESBLs in clinical isolates have been suggested. While each of the tests has merit, none of the tests is able to detect all of the ESBLs encountered. ESBLs have become widespread throughout the world and are now found in a significant percentage of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in certain countries. They have also been found in other Enterobacteriaceae strains and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains expressing these beta-lactamases will present a host of therapeutic challenges as we head into the 21st century.},

We show that this technique can infer antibiotic susceptibility and resistance for both Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We implemented this with rapid k-mer matching, which, when used on Oxford Nanopore MinION data, can run in real time. This resulted in the determination of resistance within 10 min (91{\%} sensitivity and 100{\%} specificity for S. pneumoniae and 81{\%} sensitivity and 100{\%} specificity for N. gonorrhoeae from isolates with a representative database) of starting sequencing, and within 4 h of sample collection (75{\%} sensitivity and 100{\%} specificity for S. pneumoniae) for clinical metagenomic sputum samples.

Owing to a suite of newly available computational algorithms and experimental approaches, we have a broader understanding of the genes that are being transferred and are starting to understand the ecology of HGT in natural microbial communities. This Review focuses on these new technologies, the questions they can address and their limitations. As these methods are applied more broadly, we are beginning to recognize the full extent of HGT possible within a microbiome and the punctuated dynamics of HGT, specifically in response to external stimuli.

@article{Brown.2017,
 abstract = {Environmental metagenomic analysis is typically accomplished by assigning taxonomy and/or function from whole genome sequencing or 16S amplicon sequences. Both of these approaches are limited, however, by read length, among other technical and biological factors. A nanopore-based sequencing platform, MinION{\texttrademark}, produces reads that are $\geq$1 $\times$ 104 bp in length, potentially providing for more precise assignment, thereby alleviating some of the limitations inherent in determining metagenome composition from short reads. We tested the ability of sequence data produced by MinION (R7.3 flow cells) to correctly assign taxonomy in single bacterial species runs and in three types of low-complexity synthetic communities: a mixture of DNA using equal mass from four species, a community with one relatively rare (1{\%}) and three abundant (33{\%} each) components, and a mixture of genomic DNA from 20 bacterial strains of staggered representation. Taxonomic composition of the low-complexity communities was assessed by analyzing the MinION sequence data with three different bioinformatic approaches: Kraken, MG-RAST, and One Codex. Results: Long read sequences generated from libraries prepared from single strains using the version 5 kit and chemistry, run on the original MinION device, yielded as few as 224 to as many as 3497 bidirectional high-quality (2D) reads with an average overall study length of 6000 bp. For the single-strain analyses, assignment of reads to the correct genus by different methods ranged from 53.1{\%} to 99.5{\%}, assignment to the correct species ranged from 23.9{\%} to 99.5{\%}, and the majority of misassigned reads were to closely related organisms. A synthetic metagenome sequenced with the same setup yielded 714 high quality 2D reads of approximately 5500 bp that were up to 98{\%} correctly assigned to the species level. Synthetic metagenome MinION libraries generated using version 6 kit and chemistry yielded from 899 to 3497 2D reads with lengths averaging 5700 bp with up to 98{\%} assignment accuracy at the species level. The observed community proportions for ``equal'' and ``rare'' synthetic libraries were close to the known proportions, deviating from 0.1{\%} to 10{\%} across all tests. For a 20-species mock community with staggered contributions, a sequencing run detected all but 3 species (each included at {\textless}0.05{\%} of DNA in the total mixture), 91{\%} of reads were assigned to the correct species, 93{\%} of reads were assigned to the correct genus, and {\textgreater}99{\%} of reads were assigned to the correct family. Conclusions: At the current level of output and sequence quality (just under 4 $\times$ 103 2D reads for a synthetic metagenome), MinION sequencing followed by Kraken or One Codex analysis has the potential to provide rapid and accurate metagenomic analysis where the consortium is comprised of a limited number of taxa. Important considerations noted in this study included: high sensitivity of the MinION platform to the quality of input DNA, high variability of sequencing results across libraries and flow cells, and relatively small numbers of 2D reads per analysis limit. Together, these limited detection of very rare components of the microbial consortia, and would likely limit the utility of MinION for the sequencing of high-complexity metagenomic communities where thousands of taxa are expected. Furthermore, the limitations of the currently available data analysis tools suggest there is considerable room for improvement in the analytical approaches for the characterization of microbial communities using long reads. Nevertheless, the fact that the accurate taxonomic assignment of high-quality reads generated by MinION is approaching 99.5{\%} and, in most cases, the inferred community structure mirrors the known proportions of a synthetic mixture warrants further exploration of practical application to environmental metagenomics as the platform continues to develop and improve. With further improvement in sequence throughput and error rate reduction, this platform shows great promise for precise real-time analysis of the composition and structure of more complex microbial communities.},

 abstract = {In the fight to limit the global spread of antibiotic resistance, the assembly of environmental metagenomes has the potential to provide rich contextual information (e.g., taxonomic hosts, carriage on mobile genetic elements) about antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in the environment. However, computational challenges associated with assembly can impact the accuracy of downstream analyses. This work critically evaluates the impact of assembly leveraging short reads, nanopore MinION long-reads, and a combination of the two (hybrid) on ARG contextualization for ten environmental metagenomes using seven prominent assemblers (IDBA-UD, MEGAHIT, Canu, Flye, Opera-MS, metaSpades and HybridSpades). While short-read and hybrid assemblies produced similar patterns of ARG contextualization, raw or assembled long nanopore reads produced distinct patterns. Based on an in-silico spike-in experiment using real and simulated reads, we show that low to intermediate coverage species are more likely to be incorporated into chimeric contigs across all assemblers and sequencing technologies, while more abundant species produce assemblies with a greater frequency of inversions and insertion/deletions (indels). In sum, our analyses support hybrid assembly as a valuable technique for boosting the reliability and accuracy of assembly-based analyses of ARGs and neighboring genes at environmentally-relevant coverages, provided that sufficient short-read sequencing depth is achieved.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Integrons are genomic elements that mediate horizontal gene transfer by inserting and removing genetic material using site-specific recombination. Integrons are commonly found in bacterial genomes, where they maintain a large and diverse set of genes that plays an important role in adaptation and evolution. Previous studies have started to characterize the wide range of biological functions present in integrons. However, the efforts have so far mainly been limited to genomes from cultivable bacteria and amplicons generated by PCR, thus targeting only a small part of the total integron diversity. Metagenomic data, generated by direct sequencing of environmental and clinical samples, provides a more holistic and unbiased analysis of integron-associated genes. However, the fragmented nature of metagenomic data has previously made such analysis highly challenging.

RESULTS

Here, we present a systematic survey of integron-associated genes in metagenomic data. The analysis was based on a newly developed computational method where integron-associated genes were identified by detecting their associated recombination sites. By processing contiguous sequences assembled from more than 10 terabases of metagenomic data, we were able to identify 13,397 unique integron-associated genes. Metagenomes from marine microbial communities had the highest occurrence of integron-associated genes with levels more than 100-fold higher than in the human microbiome. The identified genes had a large functional diversity spanning over several functional classes. Genes associated with defense mechanisms and mobility facilitators were most overrepresented and more than five times as common in integrons compared to other bacterial genes. As many as two thirds of the genes were found to encode proteins of unknown function. Less than 1{\%} of the genes were associated with antibiotic resistance, of which several were novel, previously undescribed, resistance gene variants.

CONCLUSIONS

Our results highlight the large functional diversity maintained by integrons present in unculturable bacteria and significantly expands the number of described integron-associated genes.},

There are numerous exposure routes to AMR originating from human waste, each of which must be quantified for its relative risk to human health. Wastewater treatment plants play a vital role in centralized collection and treatment of human sewage, but there are numerous unresolved issues in terms of the microbial ecological processes occurring within them and the extent to which they attenuate or amplify AMR. Research is needed to advance understanding of the fate of resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in various waste management systems, depending on the local constraints and intended reuse applications. World Health Organization and national AMR action plans would benefit from a more holistic 'One Water' understanding. In this article we provide a framework for research, policy, practice and public engagement aimed at limiting the spread of AMR from water and sanitation in low-, medium- and high-income countries.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The bacterial 16S rRNA gene has historically been used in defining bacterial taxonomy and phylogeny. However, there are currently no high-throughput methods to sequence full-length 16S rRNA genes present in a sample with precision.

RESULTS

We describe a method for sequencing near full-length 16S rRNA gene amplicons using the high throughput Illumina MiSeq platform and test it using DNA from human skin swab samples. Proof of principle of the approach is demonstrated, with the generation of 1,604 sequences greater than 1,300 nt from a single Nano MiSeq run, with accuracy estimated to be 100-fold higher than standard Illumina reads. The reads were chimera filtered using information from a single molecule dual tagging scheme that boosts the signal available for chimera detection.

CONCLUSIONS

This method could be scaled up to generate many thousands of sequences per MiSeq run and could be applied to other sequencing platforms. This has great potential for populating databases with high quality, near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences from under-represented taxa and environments and facilitates analyses of microbial communities at higher resolution.},

 abstract = {Antibiotic-resistant Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia is an important etiologic agent of nosocomial and cystic fibrosis infections. The primary resistance mechanism which has been reported is decreased outer membrane permeability. We previously reported the cloning and characterization of a chloramphenicol resistance determinant from an isolate of B. cepacia from a patient with cystic fibrosis that resulted in decreased drug accumulation. In the present studies we subcloned and sequenced the resistance determinant and identified gene products related to decreased drug accumulation. Additional drug resistances encoded by the determinant include resistances to trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin. Sequence analysis of a 3.4-kb subcloned fragment identified one complete and one partial open reading frame which are homologous with two of three components of a potential antibiotic efflux operon from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mexA-mexB-oprM). On the basis of sequence data, outer membrane protein analysis, protein expression systems, and a lipoprotein labelling assay, the complete open reading frame encodes an outer membrane lipoprotein which is homologous with OprM. The partial open reading frame shows homology at the protein level with the C terminus of the protein product of mexB. DNA hybridization studies demonstrated homology of an internal mexA probe with a larger subcloned fragment from B. cepacia. The finding of multiple antibiotic resistance in B. cepacia as a result of an antibiotic efflux pump is surprising because it has long been believed that resistance in this organism is caused by impermeability to antibiotics.},

Currently, a lack of consensus exists on how best to perform and interpret quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) experiments. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a reader's ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments.

CONTENT

The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. MIQE is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. MIQE details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement.

SUMMARY

Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of qPCR results.},

 abstract = {Background

Amplicon sequencing on Illumina sequencing platforms leverages their deep sequencing and multiplexing capacity but is limited in genetic resolution due to short read lengths. While Oxford Nanopore or Pacific Biosciences sequencing platforms overcome this limitation, their application has been limited due to higher error rates or lower data output.

Results

In this study, we introduce an amplicon sequencing workflow, i.e., NanoAmpli-Seq, that builds on the intramolecular-ligated nanopore consensus sequencing (INC-Seq) approach and demonstrate its application for full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. NanoAmpli-Seq includes vital improvements to the INC-Seq protocol that reduces sample processing time while significantly improving sequence accuracy. The developed protocol includes chopSeq software for fragmentation and read orientation correction of INC-Seq consensus reads while nanoClust algorithm was designed for read partitioning-based de novo clustering and within cluster consensus calling to obtain accurate full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences.

Conclusions

NanoAmpli-Seq accurately estimates the diversity of tested mock communities with average consensus sequence accuracy of 99.5{\%} for 2D and 1D2 sequencing on the nanopore sequencing platform. Nearly all residual errors in NanoAmpli-Seq sequences originate from deletions in homopolymer regions, indicating that homopolymer aware base calling or error correction may allow for sequencing accuracy comparable to short-read sequencing platforms.},

They were originally identified as a mechanism used by Gram-negative bacteria to collect antibiotic resistance genes and express multiple resistance phenotypes in synergy with transposons. More recently, their role has been broadened with the discovery of chromosomal integron (CI) structures in the genomes of hundreds of bacterial species. This review focuses on the resources carried in these elements, on their unique recombination mechanisms, and on the different mechanisms controlling the cassette dynamics. We discuss the role of the toxin/antitoxin (TA) cassettes for the stabilization of the large cassette arrays carried in the larger CIs, known as superintegrons. Finally, we explore the central role played by single-stranded DNA in the integron cassette dynamics in light of the recent discovery that the integron integrase expression is controlled by the SOS response.},

Results obtained from these studies were compared to each other without taking into consideration the followed procedure for amplicons preparation and data analysis. This negligence was mainly due to the lack of knowledge regarding the biases influencing specific steps of the microbiome investigation process. In the present study, the main technical aspects of the 16S rRNA analysis were checked giving special attention to the approach used for high throughput sequencing. More specifically, the microbial compositions of three laboratory scale biogas reactors were analyzed before and after addition of sodium oleate by sequencing the microbiome with three different approaches: 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, shotgun DNA and shotgun RNA. This comparative analysis revealed that, in amplicon sequencing, abundance of some taxa (Euryarchaeota and Spirochaetes) was biased by the inefficiency of universal primers to hybridize all the templates. Reliability of the results obtained was also influenced by the number of hypervariable regions under investigation. Finally, amplicon sequencing and shotgun DNA underestimated the Methanoculleus genus, probably due to the low 16S rRNA gene copy number encoded in this taxon.},

Identification of new aroA genes coding for EPSPS with a high level of glyphosate tolerance is essential for the development of glyphosate-tolerant crops. In the present study, the glyphosate tolerance of five bacterial aroA genes was evaluated in the E. coli aroA-defective strain ER2799 and in transgenic tobacco plants. All five aroA genes could complement the aroA-defective strain ER2799, and AM79 aroA showed the highest glyphosate tolerance. Although glyphosate treatment inhibited the growth of both WT and transgenic tobacco plants, transgenic plants expressing AM79 aroA tolerated higher concentration of glyphosate and had a higher fresh weight and survival rate than plants expressing other aroA genes. When treated with high concentration of glyphosate, lower shikimate content was detected in the leaves of transgenic plants expressing AM79 aroA than transgenic plants expressing other aroA genes. These results suggest that AM79 aroA could be a good candidate for the development of transgenic glyphosate-tolerant crops.},

The environmental selection of antibiotic resistance can be caused by either antibiotic residues or co-selecting agents such as toxic metal(loid)s. This study explored the potential role of As(III) as a co-selecting driver in the spread of antibiotic resistance in paddy soils. By applying high-throughput sequencing, we found that the diversity and composition of soil microbial communities was significantly altered by As(III) exposure, resulting in an increased proportion of potential pathogens (9.9{\%}) compared to the control soil (0.1{\%}). Meanwhile, a total of 46 As(III)-resistant isolates were obtained from As(III)-exposure soil, among which potential pathogens accounted for 54.3{\%}. These As(III)-resistant bacteria showed a high incidence of resistance to sulfanilamide (100{\%}) and streptomycin (88-93{\%}). The association between antibiotic and As(III) resistances was further investigated in a potentially pathogenic isolate by whole-genome sequencing and a transcription assay. The results showed that As(III) and antibiotic resistance genes might co-occur in a mobile genomic island and be co-regulated by As(III), implying that antibiotic resistance could be co-selected by As(III) via co-resistance and co-regulation mechanisms. Overall, these results suggest that As(III) exposure provides a strong selective pressure for the expansion of soil bacterial resistome.},

In particular, leafy-green vegetables, including lettuce and spinach, are susceptible to contamination by irrigation water, manure, and food processing and storage practices. The survival of E. coli O157:H7 and natural microflora on Romaine lettuce stored at 4 degrees C and 15 degrees C over a 9-day period was evaluated by plate counts. A two-step reverse-transcription comparative quantitative real-time PCR assay was employed to evaluate expression of genes coding for the A subunit of Shiga-toxin 1 and 2 (stx1A and stx2A), intimin (eaeA), flagellin (fliC), sigmaS--general stress sigma factor (rpoS) and iron superoxide dismutase (sodB) in E. coli O157:H7. Results indicate that reducing the storage temperature from 15 degrees C to 4 degrees C significantly (P{\textless}0.05) reduced the growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7 on Romaine lettuce, however, viable populations remained after the end of both storage periods. At end of the storage period, a 0.430 and 0.180 log decrease in E. coli O157:H7 was observed at 4 degrees C and 15 degrees C, respectively. Under both storage temperatures, total aerobic plate counts increased over the duration of the experiment. An increase in E. coli O157:H7 fold expression was observed with stx2A. Although stx1A exhibited upregulation for all storage conditions, variable gene expression was observed throughout the storage period. In addition, fliC was up-regulated during storage at 15 degrees C, while transcription at 4 degrees C storage changed only slightly. Expression of eaeA was variable at 15 degrees C with a tendency towards down-regulation, however, this gene was slightly up-regulated when stored at 4 degrees C. A slight upregulation of rpoS and sodB was also observed at 4 degrees C. In conclusion, our results suggest E. coli O157:H7 may become more virulent with prolonged storage of Romaine lettuce, particularly when stored at refrigerated temperatures.},

We characterized V1-V8 in 110 different bacterial species including common blood borne pathogens, CDC-defined select agents and environmental microflora. Sequence similarity dendrograms were created for hypervariable regions V1-V8, and for selected combinations of regions or short segments within individual hypervariable regions that might be appropriate for DNA probing and real-time PCR. We determined that V1 best differentiated among Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus sp. V2 and V3 were most suitable for distinguishing all bacterial species to the genus level except for closely related enterobacteriaceae. V2 best distinguished among Mycobacterium species and V3 among Haemophilus species. The 58 nucleotides-long V6 could distinguish among most bacterial species except enterobacteriaceae. V6 was also noteworthy for being able to differentiate among all CDC-defined select agents including Bacillus anthracis, which differed from B. cereus by a single polymorphism. V4, V5, V7 and V8 were less useful targets for genus or species-specific probes.

@article{Champlot.2010,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

PCR amplification of minute quantities of degraded DNA for ancient DNA research, forensic analyses, wildlife studies and ultrasensitive diagnostics is often hampered by contamination problems. The extent of these problems is inversely related to DNA concentration and target fragment size and concern (i) sample contamination, (ii) laboratory surface contamination, (iii) carry-over contamination, and (iv) contamination of reagents.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS

Here we performed a quantitative evaluation of current decontamination methods for these last three sources of contamination, and developed a new procedure to eliminate contaminating DNA contained in PCR reagents. We observed that most current decontamination methods are either not efficient enough to degrade short contaminating DNA molecules, rendered inefficient by the reagents themselves, or interfere with the PCR when used at doses high enough to eliminate these molecules. We also show that efficient reagent decontamination can be achieved by using a combination of treatments adapted to different reagent categories. Our procedure involves \textgreek{g}- and UV-irradiation and treatment with a mutant recombinant heat-labile double-strand specific DNase from the Antarctic shrimp Pandalus borealis. Optimal performance of these treatments is achieved in narrow experimental conditions that have been precisely analyzed and defined herein.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE

There is not a single decontamination method valid for all possible contamination sources occurring in PCR reagents and in the molecular biology laboratory and most common decontamination methods are not efficient enough to decontaminate short DNA fragments of low concentration. We developed a versatile multistrategy decontamination procedure for PCR reagents. We demonstrate that this procedure allows efficient reagent decontamination while preserving the efficiency of PCR amplification of minute quantities of DNA.},

Real-time quantitative PCR was used to demonstrate that bacteria comprised approximately 80{\%}-95{\%} of recoverable phylotypes. Archaeal phylotypes accounted for {\textless}5{\%} of the community in microbialites exposed to the water column, while structures in sediment contact supported 4- to 5-fold higher archaeal abundance. Eukaryal phylotypes were rare and indicated common aquatic diatoms that were concluded not to be part of the microbialite community. Phylogenetic analysis of rRNA genes from clone libraries (N = 491) revealed that alphaproteobacterial phylotypes were most abundant. Cyanobacterial phylotypes were highly diverse but resolved into 4 dominant genera: Acaryochloris, Leptolyngbya, Microcoleus, and Pseudanabaena. Interestingly, microbialite cyanobacteria generally affiliated phylogenetically with aquatic and coral cyanobacterial groups rather than those from stromatolites. Other commonly encountered bacterial phylotypes were from members of the Acidobacteria, with relatively low abundance of the Betaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, and Planctomycetes. Archaeal diversity (N = 53) was largely accounted for by Euryarchaeota, with most phylotypes affiliated with freshwater methanogenic taxa.},

The molecular analysis revealed that a diverse bacterial population was present in the soil sample. However, both the newly developed method and the traditional method recovered more than 400 isolates, which belonged to only four phyla: Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Although these isolates were distributed over only four major phyla, the use of the newly developed technique resulted in the successful cultivation of 35 previously uncultured strains, whereas no such strains were successfully cultivated by the traditional method. Furthermore, the study also found that the recovery of uncultured bacteria and novel isolates was related to sampling season, incubation period, and cultivation media. The use of soil collected in summer, a prolonged incubation period, and low-substrate modified media increased the recovery of uncultured and novel isolates. Overall, the results indicate that the newly designed diffusion bioreactor can mimic the natural environment, which permits the cultivation of previously uncultured bacteria.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are recognized as hotspots for horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Despite our understanding of the composition and distribution of ARGs in WWTPs, the genetic location, host, and fate of ARGs remain largely unknown.

RESULTS

In this study, we combined Oxford Nanopore and Illumina metagenomics sequencing to comprehensively uncover the resistome context of influent, activated sludge, and effluent of three WWTPs and simultaneously track the hosts of the ARGs. The results showed that most of the ARGs detected in all compartments of the WWTPs were carried by plasmids. Transposons and integrons also showed higher prevalence on plasmids than on the ARG-carrying chromosome. Notably, integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) carrying five types of ARGs were detected, and they may play an important role in facilitating the transfer of ARGs, particularly for tetracycline and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS). A broad spectrum of ARGs carried by plasmids (29 subtypes) and ICEs (4 subtypes) was persistent across the WWTPs. Host tracking showed a variety of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the effluent, suggesting the high potential for their dissemination into receiving environments. Importantly, phenotype-genotype analysis confirmed the significant role of conjugative plasmids in facilitating the survival and persistence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in the WWTPs. At last, the consistency in the quantitative results for major ARGs types revealed by Nanopore and Illumina sequencing platforms demonstrated the feasibility of Nanopore sequencing for resistome quantification.

CONCLUSION

Overall, these findings substantially expand our current knowledge of resistome in WWTPs, and help establish a baseline analysis framework to study ARGs in the environment.},

Notably, we report the discovery and characterization of a massive insertion sequence (IS)-associated AMR gene transfer network (245 combinations covering 59 AMR gene subtypes and 53 ISs) linking conjugative plasmids and phylogenetically distant pathogens, suggesting a general evolutionary mechanism for the horizontal transfer of AMR genes mediated by the interaction between conjugative plasmids and ISs. Moreover, our experimental results confirmed the importance of the observed interactions in aiding the horizontal transfer and expanding the genetic range of AMR genes within complex microbial communities.},

 abstract = {Development of antimicrobial resistance in food animals receiving antimicrobials has been well documented among bacterial isolates, especially pathogens, but information on development of antimicrobial resistance at the microbial community level during long-term feeding of antimicrobials is lacking. The objective of this study was to examine the association between inclusion of tylosin in feed and occurrence of resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B)) in the entire fecal microbial communities of beef cattle over a feeding study of 168 d. A completely randomized design included 6 pens housed together in 1 barn, with each pen housing 10 to 11 steers. The control and tylosin groups each had 3 pens, with the former receiving no antimicrobial whereas the latter received both tylosin and monensin (11 and 29.9 mg/ kg of feed, respectively, DM) in feed. The abundance of genes conferring resistance to MLS(B) (erm genes) and tetracyclines (tet genes) were quantified using class-specific, real-time PCR assays. The abundances of erm and tet genes were analyzed with pens as experimental units using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Correlations between abundance of different resistance genes were calculated using the CORR procedure of SAS. We identified 4 classes (B, F, T, and X) of erm genes in fresh fecal samples collected at wk 2, 17, and 21 of feeding. From wk 2 to 17, the abundance of erm(T) and erm(X) increased (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas that of erm(B) and erm(F) did not. The abundance of the erm genes did not further change from wk 17 to 21. The tet(A/C), tet(G), and tet gene variants encoding ribosomal protection proteins (including classes M, O, P, Q, S, T, and W) appeared to be co-selected by tylosin feeding. Such co-selection of multiresistance at community level by one antimicrobial drug used in animals has the important implication that future studies should examine resistance to not only the antimicrobials used in animals, but also other antimicrobials, especially those used in human medicine, to fully assess the potential risk associated with antimicrobial use in animals. Both the erm and tet genes appeared to be disseminated among the microbial populations in all steers housed together.},

 abstract = {Manure-derived amendments are commonly applied to soil, raising questions about whether antibiotic use in livestock could influence the soil resistome (collective antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)) and ultimately contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance to humans during food production. Here, we examined the metagenomes of soils amended with raw or composted manure generated from dairy cows administered pirlimycin and cephapirin (antibiotic) or no antibiotics (control) relative to unamended soils. Initial amendment (Day 1) with manure or compost significantly increased the diversity (richness) of ARGs in soils (p {\textless} 0.01) and resulted in distinct abundances of individual ARG types. Notably, initial amendment with antibiotic-manure significantly increased the total ARG relative abundances (per 16S rRNA gene) in the soils (2.21 $\times$ unamended soils, p {\textless} 0.001). After incubating 120 days, to simulate a wait period before crop harvest, 282 ARGs reduced 4.33-fold (median) up to 307-fold while 210 ARGs increased 2.89-fold (median) up to 76-fold in the antibiotic-manure-amended soils, resulting in reduced total ARG relative abundances equivalent to those of the unamended soils. We further assembled the metagenomic data and calculated resistome risk scores, which was recently defined as a relative index comparing co-occurrence of sequences corresponding to ARGs, mobile genetic elements, and putative pathogens on the same scaffold. Initial amendment of manure significantly increased the soil resistome risk scores, especially when generated by cows administered antibiotics, while composting reduced the effects and resulted in soil resistomes more similar to the background. The risk scores of manure-amended soils reduced to levels comparable to the unamended soils after 120 days. Overall, this study provides an integrated, high-resolution examination of the effects of prior antibiotic use, composting, and a 120-day wait period on soil resistomes following manure-derived amendment, demonstrating that all three management practices have measurable effects and should be taken into consideration in the development of policy and practice for mitigating the spread of antibiotic resistance.},

High-throughput technologies have brought tremendous changes to biological domains, and the resulting high-dimensional data has also posed enormous challenges to computational science. A Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model represented by a directed acyclic graph, which provides concise semantics to describe the relationship between entities and has an independence assumption that is suitable for sparse omics data. Bayesian networks have been broadly used in biomedical research fields, including disease risk assessment and prognostic prediction. However, the inference and visualization of Bayesian networks are unfriendly to the users lacking programming skills.

RESULTS

We developed an R/Shiny application, shinyBN, which is an online graphical user interface to facilitate the inference and visualization of Bayesian networks. shinyBN supports multiple types of input and provides flexible settings for network rendering and inference. For output, users can download network plots, prediction results and external validation results in publication-ready high-resolution figures.

CONCLUSION

Our user-friendly application (shinyBN) provides users with an easy method for Bayesian network modeling, inference and visualization via mouse clicks. shinyBN can be used in the R environment or online and is compatible with three major operating systems, including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. shinyBN is deployed at https://jiajin.shinyapps.io/shinyBN/.

This review provides an up-to-date look at arsenic-related challenges facing the global community, including current sources of arsenic, global disease burden, arsenic resistance, and shortcomings of ongoing mitigation measures, and discusses potential next steps.},

 abstract = {Public unrest about the use of antimicrobial agents in farming practice is the leading cause of increasing and the emergences of Multi-drug Resistant Bacteria that have placed pressure on the agri-food industry to act. The usage of antimicrobials in food and agriculture have direct or indirect effects on the development of Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by bacteria associated with animals and plants which may enter the food chain through consumption of meat, fish, vegetables or some other food sources. In addition to antimicrobials, recent reports have shown that AMR is associated with tolerance to heavy metals existing naturally or used in agri-food production. Besides, biocides including disinfectants, antiseptics and preservatives which are widely used in farms and slaughter houses may also contribute in the development of AMR. Though the direct transmission of AMR from food-animals and related environment to human is still vague and debatable, the risk should not be neglected. Therefore, combined global efforts are necessary for the proper use of antimicrobials, heavy metals and biocides in agri-food production to control the development of AMR. These collective measures will preserve the effectiveness of existing antimicrobials for future generations.},

The content of SMX in soil and its accumulation in lettuce were analysed. Additionally, the effects of SMX on soil microorganisms and antibiotic resistance genes were studied by Illumina high-throughput sequencing and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). The results demonstrated that the SMX content in soil reduced by 97{\%}, 86{\%} and 75{\%} in the S1, S2 and S3 treatment groups after 120~days, respectively. The accumulated SMX in lettuce was positively correlated with the initial concentration of SMX in soil. SMX contamination significantly reduced the bacterial diversity and altered the composition of bacterial and fungal communities in soil. The dominant bacterial and fungal genera in the SMX-contaminated soil were obviously different from those in the control soil. The relative abundance of sul1 (sulfonamide resistance gene) remarkably increased in the SMX-contaminated soil, while that of other ARGs, such as sul2 and tetracycline and quinolone resistance genes, showed no significant change.},

Metagenomic analysis revealed a significant shift of dominating bacterial genera harboring ARGs. Along the treatment train, 48, 95 and 80 genera were identified to be the ARG carriers in primary effluent, secondary effluent, and disinfection effluent, respectively. It was also found that secondary treatment increased the diversity of potential ARG hosts while both secondary treatment and chlorination broadened the host range of some ARGs at the genus level, which may be attributed to the spread of antibiotic resistance across bacterial genera through horizontal transfer. This study highlights the growing concerns that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may disseminate ARGs by associating this effect to specific treatment stages and by correlating ARGs with their bacterial hosts.},

The aim of this study was to characterize the genomes of 30 Listeria monocytogenes isolates collected at a pig slaughterhouse to determine the molecular basis for their persistence.

RESULTS

Comparison of the 30 L. monocytogenes genomes showed that successive isolates (i.e., persistent types) recovered from thew sampling site could be linked on the basis of single nucleotide variants confined to prophage regions. In addition, our study revealed the presence among these strains of the bcrABC cassette which is known to produce efflux pump-mediated benzalkonium chloride resistance, and which may account for the persistence of these isolates in the slaughterhouse environment. The presence of the bcrABC cassette was confirmed by WGS and PCR and the resistance phenotype was determined by measuring minimum inhibitory concentrations. Furthermore, the BC-resistant strains were found to produce lower amounts of biofilm in the presence of sublethal concentrations of BC.

CONCLUSIONS

High resolution SNP-based typing and determination of the bcrABC cassette may provide a means of distinguishing between resident and sporadic L. monocytogenes isolates, and this in turn will support better management of this pathogen in the food industry.},

We consequently expect to see a concentration gradient of antibiotic compounds radiating from areas of human population. Such antibiotics should be thought of as pollutants, as they can accumulate, and have biological effects. These antibiotic pollutants can increase rates of mutation and lateral transfer events, and continue to exert selection pressure even at sub-inhibitory concentrations. Here, we conducted a literature survey on environmental concentrations of antibiotics. We collated 887 data points from 40 peer-reviewed papers. We then determined whether these concentrations were biologically relevant by comparing them to their minimum selective concentrations, usually defined as between 1/4 and 1/230 of the minimum inhibitory concentration. Environmental concentrations of antibiotics surveyed often fall into this range. In general, the antibiotic concentrations recorded in aquatic and sediment samples were similar. These findings indicate that environmental concentrations of antibiotics are likely to be influencing microbial ecology, and to be driving the selection of antibiotic resistant bacteria.},

MexL and a MexL(A47D) mutant protein were purified from Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with carboxy-terminal hexahistidine tags. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography revealed that MexL is a tetramer in solution. MexL and MexL(A47D) oligomerization was confirmed using a genetic approach, and the MexL(A47D) mutant protein was not impaired in multimerization. Gel mobility shift and footprinting assays demonstrated that MexL, but not MexL(A47D), binds specifically to the 94-bp mexL-mexJ intergenic region to sequences located between positions -84 and -20 from the mexJ initiation codon. MexL protected about 60 nucleotides on each strand, and the protected regions overlapped almost perfectly, a finding consistent with MexL regulating the expression of both mexL and mexJK, which was ascertained by gene fusion analyses. The protected region contains predicted -10 and -35 promoter sequences for both mexL and mexJ, with partially overlapping -10 regions. The mexL promoter assignment was verified by mapping the mexL transcription start site, and the mexJ promoter was localized to the predicted regions using lacZ fusions. The MexL-protected region contains two inverted GTATTT repeats, and their location in the protected region and overlap with the mexL and mexJ promoter sequences strongly support a role in MexL binding.},

 abstract = {A broad spectrum of organic chemicals is essential to modern society. Once discharged from industrial, domestic and urban sources into the urban wastewater collection system they may transfer to the residual solids during wastewater treatment and assessment of their significance and implications for beneficial recycling of the treated sewage sludge biosolids is required. Research on organic contaminants (OCs) in biosolids has been undertaken for over thirty years and the increasing body of evidence demonstrates that the majority of compounds studied do not place human health at risk when biosolids are recycled to farmland. However, there are 143,000 chemicals registered in the European Union for industrial use and all could be potentially found in biosolids. Therefore, a literature review of 'emerging' OCs in biosolids has been conducted for a selection of chemicals of potential concern for land application based upon human toxicity, evidence of adverse effects on the environment and endocrine disruption. To identify monitoring and research priorities the selected chemicals were ranked using an assessment matrix approach. Compounds were evaluated based upon environmental persistence, human toxicity, evidence of bioaccumulation in humans and the environment, evidence of ecotoxicity and the number and quality of studies focussed on the contaminant internationally. The identified chemicals of concern were ranked in decreasing order of priority: perfluorinated chemicals (PFOS, PFOA); polychlorinated alkanes (PCAs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs); organotins (OTs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC); benzothiazoles; antibiotics and pharmaceuticals; synthetic musks; bisphenol A, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), steroids; phthalate acid esters (PAEs) and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMSs). A number of issues were identified and recommendations for the prioritisation of further research and monitoring of 'emerging' OCs for the agricultural use of biosolids are provided. In particular, a number of 'emerging' OCs (PFOS, PFOA and PCAs) were identified for priority attention that are environmentally persistent and potentially toxic with unique chemical properties, or are present in large concentrations in sludge, that make it theoretically possible for them to enter human and ecological food-chains from biosolids-amended soil.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Next generation sequencing (NGS) may be an alternative to phenotypic susceptibility testing for surveillance and clinical diagnosis. However, current bioinformatics methods may be associated with false positives and negatives. In this study, a novel mapping method was developed and benchmarked to two different methods in current use for identification of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial WGS data.

METHODS

A novel method, KmerResistance, which examines the co-occurrence of k-mers between the WGS data and a database of resistance genes, was developed. The performance of this method was compared with two previously described methods; ResFinder and SRST2, which use an assembly/BLAST method and BWA, respectively, using two datasets with a total of 339 isolates, covering five species, originating from the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust and Danish pig farms. The predicted resistance was compared with the observed phenotypes for all isolates. To challenge further the sensitivity of the in silico methods, the datasets were also down-sampled to 1{\%} of the reads and reanalysed.

RESULTS

The best results were obtained by identification of resistance genes by mapping directly against the raw reads. This indicates that information might be lost during assembly. KmerResistance performed significantly better than the other methods, when data were contaminated or only contained few sequence reads.

CONCLUSIONS

Read mapping is superior to assembly-based methods and the new KmerResistance seemingly outperforms currently available methods particularly when including datasets with few reads.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

As the cost of sequencing has declined, clinical diagnostics based on next generation sequencing (NGS) have become reality. Diagnostics based on sequencing will require rapid and precise mapping against redundant databases because some of the most important determinants, such as antimicrobial resistance and core genome multilocus sequence typing (MLST) alleles, are highly similar to one another. In order to facilitate this, a novel mapping method, KMA (k-mer alignment), was designed. KMA is able to map raw reads directly against redundant databases, it also scales well for large redundant databases. KMA uses k-mer seeding to speed up mapping and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to accurately align extensions from k-mer seeds. Multi-mapping reads are resolved using a novel sorting scheme (ConClave scheme), ensuring an accurate selection of templates.

RESULTS

The functionality of KMA was compared with SRST2, MGmapper, BWA-MEM, Bowtie2, Minimap2 and Salmon, using both simulated data and a dataset of Escherichia coli mapped against resistance genes and core genome MLST alleles. KMA outperforms current methods with respect to both accuracy and speed, while using a comparable amount of memory.

CONCLUSION

With KMA, it was possible map raw reads directly against redundant databases with high accuracy, speed and memory efficiency.},

We characterised the impact of the long-term application of a mixture of veterinary antibiotics alone (tylosin, sulfamethazine and chlortetracycline) on class 1 integron prevalence and soil microbiota composition. Class 1 integron prevalence increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.005) from 0.006{\%} in control samples to 0.064{\%} in the treated plots. Soil microbiota was analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and revealed significant alterations in composition. Of the 19 significantly different (P {\textless} 0.05) OTUs identified, 16 were of the Class Proteobacteria and these decreased in abundance relative to the control plots. Only one OTU, of the Class Cyanobacteria, was shown to increase in abundance significantly; a curiosity given the established sensitivity of this class to antibiotics. We hypothesise that the overrepresentation of Proteobacteria as OTUs that decreased significantly in relative abundance, coupled with the observations of an increase in integron prevalence, may represent a strong selective pressure on these taxa.},

@article{CollinsFairclough.2018,
 abstract = {The Riverton City dump is Jamaica's largest solid waste disposal site, but it lacks engineered protection for leachate containment and treatment. Shotgun metagenomics was used to survey the microbial communities in the Riverton City dump leachate and in surface waters of the Duhaney River, an urban waterway abutting the dump. The community within the leachate pond was taxonomically distinct from that found in the surface waters of the Duhaney River. Higher microbial diversity was observed within the dump leachate, with members of the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Tenericutes being the most abundant, while the river community was dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria The microbial communities exhibit similar functional potential profiles, including chemoorganoheterotrophy as the dominant metabolism, and the potential to degrade aromatic compounds. From reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), organisms within both environments are predicted to survive in the presence of multiple antibiotics, antiseptics, biocides, and metals. Strong virulence potential coincided with the most diverse multiple resistance profiles in 1 of 5 leachate MAGs and 5 of 33 river MAGs. Unexpectedly, the microbial resistance profiles were more varied and widespread in the river populations, where we had expected the chemical composition of the leachate to select and enrich for resistance characteristics. This study provides valuable insights into the total functional potential of a landfill leachate microbial community and identifies possible human health hazards within the Duhaney River and Riverton City dump, urban environments with the potential to impact human populations.IMPORTANCE Landfill leachate is a persistent contamination threat for terrestrial waters. Microbial metabolism in landfills transforms contaminants and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. A better understanding of landfill-associated microbial communities will inform bioremediation of solid waste environments and improve pathogen monitoring. We leveraged shotgun metagenomics to investigate the microbial communities of the Riverton City dump and the adjoining Duhaney River near Kingston City, Jamaica. We identified no overlap between the microbial communities inhabiting the Riverton City dump leachate and the Duhaney River. Both communities are predicted to degrade aromatic compounds, which are ubiquitous environmental pollutants. Adversely, microbes in both environments are predicted to withstand widely used antibiotics, antiseptics, and metal contamination. The absence of evidence for microbial transfer from the leachate to the river is encouraging; however, the Duhaney River contained several organisms with predicted pathogenic lifestyles, indicating that the river represents a human health risk regardless of impact from the dump.},

 abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is an increasing global problem resulting from the pressure of antibiotic usage, greater mobility of the population, and industrialization. Many antibiotic resistance genes are believed to have originated in microorganisms in the environment, and to have been transferred to other bacteria through mobile genetic elements. Among others, \textgreek{b}-lactam antibiotics show clinical efficacy and low toxicity, and they are thus widely used as antimicrobials. Resistance to \textgreek{b}-lactam antibiotics is conferred by \textgreek{b}-lactamase genes and penicillin-binding proteins, which are chromosomal- or plasmid-encoded, although there is little information available on the contribution of other mobile genetic elements, such as phages. This study is focused on three genes that confer resistance to \textgreek{b}-lactam antibiotics, namely two \textgreek{b}-lactamase genes (blaTEM and blaCTX-M9) and one encoding a penicillin-binding protein (mecA) in bacteriophage DNA isolated from environmental water samples. The three genes were quantified in the DNA isolated from bacteriophages collected from 30 urban sewage and river water samples, using quantitative PCR amplification. All three genes were detected in the DNA of phages from all the samples tested, in some cases reaching 104 gene copies (GC) of blaTEM or 102 GC of blaCTX-M and mecA. These values are consistent with the amount of fecal pollution in the sample, except for mecA, which showed a higher number of copies in river water samples than in urban sewage. The bla genes from phage DNA were transferred by electroporation to sensitive host bacteria, which became resistant to ampicillin. blaTEM and blaCTX were detected in the DNA of the resistant clones after transfection. This study indicates that phages are reservoirs of resistance genes in the environment.},

Consequently, growth-based antimicrobial screens performed in conditions modeling aspects of bacterial disease states have the potential to identify new classes of antimicrobials that would be missed by screens performed in conventional laboratory media. Accordingly, we performed screens of the Selleck library of 853 FDA approved drugs for agents that exhibit antimicrobial activity toward the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii during growth in human serum, lung surfactant, and/or the organism in the biofilm state and compared those results to that of conventional laboratory medium. Results revealed that a total of 90 compounds representing 73 antibiotics and 17 agents that were developed for alternative therapeutic indications displayed antimicrobial properties toward the test strain in at least one screening condition. Of the active library antibiotics only four agents, rifampin, rifaximin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, exhibited antimicrobial activity toward the organism during all screening conditions, whereas the remainder were inactive in $\geq$ 1 condition; 56 antibiotics were inactive during serum growth, 25 and 38 were inactive toward lung surfactant grown and biofilm-associated cells, respectively, suggesting that subsets of antibiotics may outperform others in differing infection settings. Moreover, 9 antibiotics that are predominantly used for the treatment Gram-positive pathogens and 10 non-antibiotics lacked detectable antimicrobial activity toward A. baumannii grown in conventional medium but were active during $\geq$ 1 alternative growth condition(s). Such agents may represent promising anti-Acinetobacter agents that would have likely been overlooked by antimicrobial whole cell screening assays performed in traditional laboratory screening media.},

The persistence of anthropogenic compounds is due to their recent introduction into the environment; microbes in soil and water have had relatively little time to evolve efficient mechanisms for degradation of these new compounds. Some anthropogenic compounds are easily degraded, whereas others are degraded very slowly or only partially, leading to accumulation of toxic products. This review examines the factors that affect the ability of microbes to degrade anthropogenic compounds and the mechanisms by which new pathways emerge in nature. New approaches for engineering microbes with enhanced degradative abilities include assembly of pathways using enzymes from multiple organisms, directed evolution of inefficient enzymes, and genome shuffling to improve microbial fitness under the challenging conditions posed by contaminated environments.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are a key component of arid land ecosystems, where they render critical services such as soil surface stabilization and nutrient fertilization. The bundle-forming, filamentous, non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Microcoleus vaginatus is a pioneer primary producer, often the dominant member of the biocrust microbiome, and the main source of leaked organic carbon. We hypothesized that, by analogy to the rhizosphere of plant roots, M. vaginatus may shape the microbial populations of heterotrophs around it, forming a specialized cyanosphere.

RESULTS

By physically isolating bundles of M. vaginatus from biocrusts, we were able to study the composition of the microbial populations attached to it, in comparison to the bulk soil crust microbiome by means of high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing. We did this in two M. vaginatus-dominated biocrust from distinct desert biomes. We found that a small, selected subset of OTUs was significantly enriched in close proximity to M. vaginatus. Furthermore, we also found that a majority of bacteria (corresponding to some two thirds of the reads) were significantly more abundant away from this cyanobacterium. Phylogenetic placements suggest that all typical members of the cyanosphere were copiotrophs and that many were diazotrophs (Additional~file~1: Tables S2 and S3). Nitrogen fixation genes were in fact orders of magnitude more abundant in this cyanosphere than in the bulk biocrust soil as assessed by qPCR. By contrary, competition for light, CO2, and low organic carbon concentrations defined at least a part of the OTUs segregating from the cyanobacterium.

CONCLUSIONS

We showed that M. vaginatus acts as a significant spatial organizer of the biocrust microbiome. On the one hand, it possesses a compositionally differentiated cyanosphere that concentrates the nitrogen-fixing function. We propose that a mutualism based on C for N exchange between M. vaginatus and copiotrophic diazotrophs helps sustains this cyanosphere and that this consortium constitutes the true pioneer community enabling the colonization of nitrogen-poor soils. On the other hand, a large number of biocrust community members segregate away from the vicinity of M. vaginatus, potentially through competition for light or CO2, or because of a preference for oligotrophy.},

JavaScript-based Circos libraries have been widely implemented to generate interactive Circos plots in web applications. However, these libraries require either local installation, which requires the compilation of extra libraries, or extra data processing procedures to prepare input and configuration for each track of plot, which limits the utility and capability of integration with powerful R packages. In this report, we present interacCircos, an R package for creating interactive Circos plots through the integration of JavaScript-based libraries. interacCircos can simply and flexibly implement 14 track-plot functions and 7 auxiliary functions for presenting large-scale genomic data in interactive Circos plots.

During screens for antimicrobials, as many as 50{\%} of actinomycete strains are discarded because they produce a known antibiotic (Supplementary Fig. 1) (ref. 2). Despite each strain likely having the capacity to produce many compounds, strains are abandoned because the already characterized antibiotic could interfere with screening for, or purification of, newly discovered compounds3. We applied CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering to knockout genes encoding two of the most frequently rediscovered antibiotics, streptothricin or streptomycin, in 11 actinomycete strains. We report that this simple approach led to production of different antibiotics that were otherwise masked. We were able to rapidly discover rare and previously unknown variants of antibiotics including thiolactomycin, amicetin, phenanthroviridin and 5-chloro-3-formylindole. This strategy could be applied to existing strain collections to realize their biosynthetic potential.},

We made a program - IntegronFinder - to identify integrons with high accuracy and sensitivity. IntegronFinder is available as a standalone program and as a web application. It searches for attC sites using covariance models, for integron-integrases using HMM profiles, and for other features (promoters, attI site) using pattern matching. We searched for integrons, integron-integrases lacking attC sites, and clusters of attC sites lacking a neighboring integron-integrase in bacterial genomes. All these elements are especially frequent in genomes of intermediate size. They are missing in some key phyla, such as \textgreek{a}-Proteobacteria, which might reflect selection against cell lineages that acquire integrons. The similarity between attC sites is proportional to the number of cassettes in the integron, and is particularly low in clusters of attC sites lacking integron-integrases. The latter are unexpectedly abundant in genomes lacking integron-integrases or their remains, and have a large novel pool of cassettes lacking homologs in the databases. They might represent an evolutionary step between the acquisition of genes within integrons and their stabilization in the new genome.},

This is true, but the real wonder is the rise of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, communities, and the environment concomitant with their use. The extraordinary genetic capacities of microbes have benefitted from man's overuse of antibiotics to exploit every source of resistance genes and every means of horizontal gene transmission to develop multiple mechanisms of resistance for each and every antibiotic introduced into practice clinically, agriculturally, or otherwise. This review presents the salient aspects of antibiotic resistance development over the past half-century, with the oft-restated conclusion that it is time to act. To achieve complete restitution of therapeutic applications of antibiotics, there is a need for more information on the role of environmental microbiomes in the rise of antibiotic resistance. In particular, creative approaches to the discovery of novel antibiotics and their expedited and controlled introduction to therapy are obligatory.},

In 31/79 integron positive E. coli strains, the gene cassette regions could not be PCR amplified using standard primers. DNA sequence analysis of 6 serologically diverse strains revealed atypical integrons harboured the dfrA5 cassette gene and only 24 bp of the integron 3'-conserved segment (CS) remained, due to the insertion of IS26. PCR targeting intI1 and IS26 followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis identified the integron-dfrA5-IS26 element in 27 E. coli strains of bovine origin and 4 strains of human origin. Southern hybridization and transformation studies revealed the integron-dfrA5-IS26 gene arrangement was either chromosomally located or plasmid borne. Plasmid location in 4/9 E. coli strains and PCR linkage of Tn21 transposition genes with the intI1 gene in 20/31 strains, suggests this element is readily disseminated by horizontal transfer.},

Here we report targeted metagenomic analyses of rigorously authenticated ancient DNA from 30,000-year-old Beringian permafrost sediments and the identification of a highly diverse collection of genes encoding resistance to \textgreek{b}-lactam, tetracycline and glycopeptide antibiotics.

Bacteria can acquire antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) by horizontal transfer mediated by mobile genetic elements, where the role of phages in their dissemination in natural environments has not yet been clearly resolved. From metagenomic studies, we showed that the mean proportion of predicted ARGs found in prophages (0-0.0028{\%}) was lower than those present in the free viruses (0.001-0.1{\%}). Beta-lactamase, from viruses in the swine gut, represented 0.10 {\%} of the predicted genes. Overall, in the environment, the ARG distribution associated with viruses was strongly linked to human activity, and the low dN/dS ratio observed advocated for a negative selection of the ARGs harbored by the viruses. Our network approach showed that viruses were linked to putative pathogens (Enterobacterales and vibrionaceae) and were considered key vehicles in ARG transfer, similar to plasmids. Therefore, these ARGs could then be disseminated at larger temporal and spatial scales than those included in the bacterial genomes, allowing for time-delayed genetic exchanges.},

There are also relatively few bacterial species from natural environments which can be cultured in vitro. Extracting plasmids from the cultivable fraction of these complex microbiomes may only represent a fraction of the total antibiotic resistance plasmids present. We compared different methods of plasmid extraction from broiler cecal samples, whose resistance could be expressed in a human pathogen-Escherichia coli. We found that kits designed for DNA extraction from complex samples such as soil or feces did not extract intact plasmid DNA. Commercial kits specific for plasmid extraction were also generally unsuccessful, most likely due to the complexity of our sample and intended use of the kits with bacterial culture. An alkaline lysis method specific for plasmid extraction was ineffective, even with further optimization. Transposon-aided capture of plasmids (TRACA) allowed for the acquirement of a small range of resistance plasmids. Multiple displacement amplification provided the broadest range of resistance plasmids by amplifying all extracted circular plasmid DNA, but the results were not reproducible across all samples. Exogenous plasmid isolation enabled the extraction of resistance plasmids from the microbial fraction by relying on the mobility of the plasmids in the sample. This was the most consistent method from which we obtained a range of resistance plasmids from our samples. We therefore recommend the use of the exogenous plasmid isolation method in order to reliably obtain the greatest representation of the total antibiotic resistance plasmidome in complex samples. While this method has limitations, it is one which will vastly increase our current knowledge of antibiotic resistance plasmids present in complex environments and which are capable of transferring to a human and animal pathogen and environmental contaminant.},

With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, they have become a primary tool to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces. Disinfectant Quats have very low vapor pressure, and following the use phase of the products in which they are found, disposal is typically {\textquotedbl}down-the-drain{\textquotedbl} to wastewater treatment systems. Consequently, the potential for the greatest environmental effect is to the aquatic environment, from treated effluent, and potentially to soils, which might be amended with wastewater biosolids. Among the earliest used and still common disinfectant Quats are the alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (ADBAC) compounds and the dialkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC) compounds. They are cationic surfactants often found in consumer and commercial surface cleaners. Because of their biocidal properties, disinfectant Quats are heavily regulated for human and environmental safety around the world. Consequently, there is a robust database of information regarding the ecological hazards and environmental fate of ADBAC and DDAC; however, some of the data presented are from unpublished studies that have been submitted to and reviewed by regulatory agencies (i.e., EPA and European Chemicals Agency) to support antimicrobial product registration. We summarize the available environmental fate data and the acute and chronic aquatic ecotoxicity data for freshwater species, including algae, invertebrates, fish, and plants using peer-reviewed literature and unpublished data submitted to and summarized by regulatory agencies. The lower limit of the range of the ecotoxicity data for disinfectant Quats tends to be lower than that for other surface active agents, such as nonionic or anionic surfactants. However, ecotoxicity is mitigated by environmental fate characteristics, the data for which we also summarize, including high biodegradability and a strong tendency to sorb to wastewater biosolids, sediment, and soil. As a result, disinfectant Quats are largely removed during wastewater treatment, and those residues discharged in treated effluent are likely to rapidly bind to suspended solids or sediments, thus mitigating their toxicity.},

In particular, methodological variations appear to affect results from different ecosystems differently, thus increasing the risk of biological and ecological misinterpretation. Part of the difficulty is derived from the lack of knowledge concerning the true microbial diversity and because no approach can guarantee accessing microorganisms in the same proportion in which they exist in the environment. However, the variation between different approaches (e.g. DNA extraction techniques, sequence annotation systems) can be used to evaluate whether observations are meaningful. These methodological variations can be integrated into the error analysis before comparing microbial communities.},

The democratization of whole-genome sequencing has led to an accumulation of genomic data that render possible a population phylogenomic approach to the emergence of virulence. Few lineages are responsible for the pathologies compared with the diversity of commensal strains. These lineages emerged multiple times during E. coli evolution, mainly by acquiring virulence genes located on mobile elements, but in a specific chromosomal phylogenetic background. This repeated emergence of stable and cosmopolitan lineages argues for an optimization of strain fitness through epistatic interactions between the virulence determinants and the remaining genome.},

Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous in freshwater, where they are exposed to antibiotics and resistant organisms, but their role on water resistome was never evaluated. Data concerning the effects of antibiotics on cyanobacteria, obtained by distinct methodologies, is often contradictory. This emphasizes the importance of developing procedures to understand the trends of antibiotic susceptibility in cyanobacteria. In this study we aimed to evaluate the susceptibility of four cyanobacterial isolates from different genera (Microcystis aeruginosa, Aphanizomenon gracile, Chrisosporum bergii, Planktothix agradhii), and among them nine isolates from the same specie (M. aeruginosa) to distinct antibiotics (amoxicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, kanamycine, gentamicine, tetracycline, trimethoprim, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin). We used a method adapted from the bacteria standard broth microdilution. Cyanobacteria were exposed to serial dilution of each antibiotic (0.0015-1.6 mg/L) in Z8 medium (20 $\pm$ 1°C; 14/10 h L/D cycle; light intensity 16 $\pm$ 4 \textgreek{m}Em(-2)s(-1)). Cell growth was followed overtime (OD450nm /microscopic examination) and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were calculated for each antibiotic/isolate. We found that \textgreek{b}-lactams exhibited the lower MICs, aminoglycosides, tetracycline and norfloxacine presented intermediate MICs; none of the isolates were susceptible to trimethoprim and nalidixic acid. The reduced susceptibility of all tested cyanobacteria to some antibiotics suggests that they might be naturally non-susceptible to these compounds, or that they might became non-susceptible due to antibiotic contamination pressure, or to the transfer of genes from resistant bacteria present in the environment.},

In the present study, the diversity of putative environmental integron-cassettes, as~well as their potential bacterial hosts in the Velhas River (Brazil), was explored through intI-attC and 16S rRNA amplicons deep sequencing. RESULTS AND~DISCUSSION: ORFs related to different biological processes were observed, from DNA integration to oxidation-reduction. ARGs-cassettes were mainly~associated with class 1 mobile integrons carried by pathogenic Gammaproteobacteria, and possibly sedentary chromosomal integrons hosted by~Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Two putative novel ARG-cassettes homologs to fosB3 and novA were detected. Regarding 16SrRNA gene analysis,~taxonomic and functional profiles unveiled Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria as dominant phyla. Betaproteobacteria,~Alphaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria classes were the main contributors for KEGG orthologs associated with resistance.

 abstract = {The impact of human activities on the spread and on the persistence of antibiotic resistances in the environment is still far from being understood. The natural background of resistances is influenced by human activities, and the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are among the main sources of the release of antibiotic resistance into the environment. The various treatments of WWTPs provide a number of different environmental conditions potentially favoring the selection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and thereby their well-documented spread in the environment. Although the distribution of different ARGs in WWTPs has been deeply investigated, very little is known on the ecology and on the molecular mechanisms underlying the selection of specific ARGs. This study investigates the fate of diverse ARGs, heavy metal resistance genes (HMRGs) and of a mobile element (the class I integron) in three WWTPs. Abundances of the different genetic markers were correlated to each other and their relation to biotic and abiotic factors (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, prokaryotic cell abundance and its relative distribution in single cells and aggregates) influencing the microbial communities in the different treatment phases in three WWTPs, were investigated. Water samples were analyzed for the abundance of six ARGs (tetA, sulII, blaTEM, blaCTXM,ermB, and qnrS), two HMRGs (czcA and arsB), and of the class I integron (int1). The measured variables clustered in two well-defined groups, the first including tetA, ermB, qnrS and the different biotic and abiotic factors, and a second group around the genes sulII, czcA, arsB and int1. Moreover, the dynamics of sulII, HMRGs, and int1 correlated strongly. Our results suggest a potentially crucial role of HMRGs in the spread, mediated by mobile elements, of some ARGs, i.e. sulII. The possibility of a relation between heavy metal contamination and the spread of ARGs in WWTPs calls for further research to clarify the mechanisms of co-selection and their ecology, in order to implement the removal efficiency of the applied treatments.},

Naturally transformable cells of Acinetobacter baylyi were exposed to DNA from integron-carrying strains of the genera Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, and Salmonella to determine the nature and frequency of transfer. Exposure to the various DNA sources resulted in acquisition of antibiotic resistance traits as well as entire integrons and transposons, over a 24 h exposure period. DNA incorporation was not solely dependent on integrase functions or the genetic relatedness between species. DNA sequence analyses revealed that several mechanisms facilitated stable integration in the recipient genome depending on the nature of the donor DNA; homologous or heterologous recombination and various types of transposition (Tn21-like and IS26-like). Both donor strains and transformed isolates were extensively characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, integron- and cassette-specific PCRs, DNA sequencing, pulsed field gel electrophoreses (PFGE), Southern blot hybridizations, and by re-transformation assays. Two transformant strains were also genome-sequenced. Our data demonstrate that natural transformation facilitates interspecies transfer of genetic elements, suggesting that the transient presence of DNA in the cytoplasm may be sufficient for genomic integration to occur. Our study provides a plausible explanation for why sequence-conserved transposons, IS elements and integrons can be found disseminated among bacterial species. Moreover, natural transformation of integron harboring populations of competent bacteria revealed that interspecies exchange of gene cassettes can be highly efficient, and independent on genetic relatedness between donor and recipient. In conclusion, natural transformation provides a much broader capacity for horizontal acquisitions of genetic elements and hence, resistance traits from divergent species than previously assumed.},

Here, we review the dissemination pattern of common cassette arrays with a focus on the bacterial species, the geographical dispersal pattern and the environments in which they reside. Conserved arrays of gene cassettes are found in at least 74 countries and 72 species present in different environments. The factors governing the further spread and population dynamics of these cassette arrays remain to be determined.},

 abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a threat to global public health and the identification of genetic determinants of AMR is a critical component to epidemiological investigations. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) provides opportunities for investigation of AMR across all microbial genomes in a sample (i.e.~the metagenome). Previously, we presented MEGARes, a hand-curated AMR database and annotation structure developed to facilitate the analysis of AMR within metagenomic samples (i.e. the resistome). Along with MEGARes, we released AmrPlusPlus, a bioinformatics pipeline that interfaces with MEGARes to identify and quantify AMR gene accessions contained within a metagenomic sequence dataset. Here, we present MEGARes 2.0 (https://megares.meglab.org), which incorporates previously published resistance sequences for antimicrobial drugs, while also expanding to include published sequences for metal and biocide resistance determinants. In MEGARes 2.0, the nodes of the acyclic hierarchical ontology include four antimicrobial compound types, 57 classes, 220 mechanisms of resistance, and~1,345 gene groups that classify the 7,868 accessions. In addition, we present an updated version of AmrPlusPlus (AMR ++ version 2.0), which improves accuracy of classifications, as well as expanding scalability and usability.},

 abstract = {Plasmids are genetic elements that enable rapid adaptation and evolution by transferring genes conferring selective advantages to their hosts. Conjugative plasmids are predominantly responsible for the global dissemination of antimicrobial resistance, representing an important threat to global health. As the number of plasmid sequences grows exponentially, it becomes critical to depict the global diversity and decipher the distribution of circulating plasmids in the bacterial community. To this end, we created COMPASS, a novel and comprehensive database compiling 12,084 complete plasmids with associated metadata from 1571 distinct species isolated worldwide over more than 100 years. The curation of the database allowed us to identify identical plasmids across different bacteria revealing mainly intraspecies dissemination and rare cases of horizontal transmission. We outlined and analyzed all relevant features, plasmid properties, host range and characterized their replication and mobilization systems. After an exhaustive comparison of PlasmidFinder and MOB-typer, the MOB-typer-based analysis revealed that the current knowledge embedded in the current typing schemes fails to classify all the plasmid sequences collected in COMPASS. We were able to categorize 6828 and 5229 plasmids by replicon and MOB typing, respectively, mostly associated with Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. We then searched for the presence of multiple core genes involved in replication and propagation. Our results showed that 2403 plasmids carried multiple replicons that were distributed in 206 bacterial species. The co-integration of replicon types from different incompatibility (Inc) groups is an adaptive mechanism, which plays an important role in plasmid survival and dissemination by extending their host range. Our results highlight the crucial role of IncF alleles (present in 56{\%} of all multireplicons) and revealed that IncH, IncR, and IncU replicons were also frequently carried in multireplicons. Here, we provided a comprehensive picture of the different IncF subtypes by identifying 20 different profiles in 849 IncF multireplicons, which were mostly associated with Enterobacteriaceae. These results could provide the basis for a novel IncF plasmid nomenclature based on different allelic profiles.},

 abstract = {Plasmids harbor transferable genes that contribute to the functional repertoire of microbial communities, yet their contributions to metagenomes are often overlooked. Environmental plasmids have the potential to spread antibiotic resistance to clinical microbial strains. In soils, high microbiome diversity and high variability in plasmid characteristics present a challenge for studying plasmids. To improve the understanding of soil plasmids, we present RefSoil+, a database containing plasmid sequences from 922 soil microorganisms. Soil plasmids were larger than other described plasmids, which is a trait associated with plasmid mobility. There was a weak relationship between chromosome size and plasmid size and no relationship between chromosome size and plasmid number, suggesting that these genomic traits are independent in soil. We used RefSoil+ to inform the distributions of antibiotic resistance genes among soil microorganisms compared to those among nonsoil microorganisms. Soil-associated plasmids, but not chromosomes, had fewer antibiotic resistance genes than other microorganisms. These data suggest that soils may offer limited opportunity for plasmid-mediated transfer of described antibiotic resistance genes. RefSoil+ can serve as a reference for the diversity, composition, and host associations of plasmid-borne functional genes in soil, a utility that will be enhanced as the database expands. Our study improves the understanding of soil plasmids and provides a resource for assessing the dynamics of the genes that they carry, especially genes conferring antibiotic resistances. IMPORTANCE Soil-associated plasmids have the potential to transfer antibiotic resistance genes from environmental to clinical microbial strains, which is a public health concern. A specific resource is needed to aggregate the knowledge of soil plasmid characteristics so that the content, host associations, and dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes can be assessed and then tracked between the environment and the clinic. Here, we present RefSoil+, a database of soil-associated plasmids. RefSoil+ presents a contemporary snapshot of antibiotic resistance genes in soil that can serve as a reference as novel plasmids and transferred antibiotic resistances are discovered. Our study broadens our understanding of plasmids in soil and provides a community resource of important plasmid-associated genes, including antibiotic resistance genes.},

We examined the prevalence and abundance of IncP-1 plasmids and IS1071, two MGEs that are frequently linked with organic xenobiotic degradation, in laboratory and field ecosystems with and without pesticide pollution history. The ecosystems included on-farm biopurification systems (BPS) processing pesticide-contaminated wastewater and soil. Comparison of IncP-1/IS1071 prevalence between pesticide-treated and nontreated soil and BPS microcosms suggested that both IncP-1 and IS1071 proliferated as a response to pesticide treatment. The increased prevalence of IncP-1 plasmids and IS1071-specific sequences in treated systems was accompanied by an increase in the capacity to mineralize the applied pesticides. Both elements were also encountered in high abundance in field BPS ecosystems that were in operation at farmyards and that showed the capacity to degrade/mineralize a wide range of chlorinated aromatics and pesticides. In contrast, IS1071 and especially IncP-1, MGE were less abundant in field ecosystems without pesticide history although some of them still showed a high IS1071 abundance. Our data suggest that MGE-containing organisms were enriched in pesticide-contaminated environments like BPS where they might contribute to spreading of catabolic genes and to pathway assembly.},

However, in environmental settings, the identity of the IS1071 genetic cargo and its correspondence to the local selective conditions remain unknown. To respond, we developed a long-range PCR approach amplifying accessory genes between two IS1071 copies from community DNA followed by amplicon sequencing. We applied this method to pesticide-exposed environments, i.e. linuron-treated agricultural soil and on-farm biopurification systems (BPS) treating complex agricultural wastewater, as to non-treated controls. Amplicons were mainly recovered from the pesticide-exposed environments and the BPS matrix showed a higher size diversity compared to the agricultural soil. Retrieved gene functions mirrored the main selection pressure as (i) a large fraction of the BPS amplicons contained a high variety of genes/gene clusters related to the degradation of organics including herbicides present in the wastewater and (ii) in the agricultural soil, recovered genes were associated with linuron degradation. Our metagenomic analysis extends observations from cultured isolates and provides evidence that IS1071 is a carrier of catabolic genes in xenobiotica stressed environments and contributes to community level adaptation towards pesticide biodegradation.},

We compared the relative abundance distributions obtained with the two sequencing strategies and then tested their capability to distinguish the experimental conditions. The results showed that 16S rRNA gene sequencing detects only part of the gut microbiota community revealed by shotgun sequencing. Specifically, when a sufficient number of reads is available, Shotgun sequencing has more power to identify less abundant taxa than 16S sequencing. Finally, we showed that the less abundant genera detected only by shotgun sequencing are biologically meaningful, being able to discriminate between the experimental conditions as much as the more abundant genera detected by both sequencing strategies.},

Storing manure for extended periods could significantly bias the composition of enteric bacterial populations subsequently released into the environment. Here, we compared populations of Escherichia coli isolated from fresh feces and from the manure-holding tank (stored manure) of a commercial swine farm, each sampled monthly for 6 months. The 4,668 confirmed E. coli isolates were evaluated for resistance to amikacin, ampicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole. A subset of 1,687 isolates was fingerprinted by repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) with the BOXA1R primer to evaluate the diversity and the population structure of the collection. The population in the stored manure was generally more diverse than that in the fresh feces. Half of the genotypes detected in the stored manure were never detected in the fresh fecal material, and only 16{\%} were detected only in the fresh feces. But the majority of the isolates (84{\%}) were assigned to the 34{\%} of genotypes shared between the two environments. The structure of the E. coli population showed important monthly variations both in the extent and distribution of the diversity of the observed genotypes. The frequency of detection of resistance to specific antibiotics was not significantly different between the two collections and varied importantly between monthly samples. Resistance to multiple antibiotics was much more temporally dynamic in the fresh feces than in the stored manure. There was no relationship between the distribution of rep-PCR fingerprints and the distribution of antibiotic resistance profiles, suggesting that specific antibiotic resistance determinants were dynamically distributed within the population.},

Although the bacteria of cattle feces have been well characterized using culture-based and culture-independent methods, techniques have been lacking to correlate total community composition with community function. We used high throughput sequencing of total DNA extracted from fecal material to characterize general community composition and examine the repertoire of microbial genes present in beef cattle feces, including genes associated with antibiotic resistance and bacterial virulence. Results suggest that traditional 16S sequencing using {\textquotedbl}universal{\textquotedbl} primers to generate full-length sequence may under represent Acitinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Over eight percent (8.4{\%}) of the sequences from our beef cattle fecal pool sample could be categorized as virulence genes, including a suite of genes associated with resistance to antibiotic and toxic compounds (RATC). This is a higher proportion of virulence genes found in Sargasso sea, chicken cecum, and cow rumen samples, but comparable to the proportion found in Antarctic marine derived lake, human fecal, and farm soil samples. The quantitative nature of metagenomic data, combined with the large number of RATC classes represented in samples from widely different habitats indicates that metagenomic data can be used to track relative amounts of antibiotic resistance genes in individual animals over time. Consequently, these data can be used to generate sample-specific and temporal antibiotic resistance gene profiles to facilitate an understanding of the ecology of the microbial communities in each habitat as well as the epidemiology of antibiotic resistant gene transport between and among habitats.},

Understanding from which bacterial taxa these genes were mobilized, and whether their origin taxa share common traits, is critical for predicting which environments and conditions contribute to the emergence of novel resistance genes. This knowledge may prove valuable for limiting or delaying future transfer of novel resistance genes into pathogens.

Here, we summarize, amend and scrutinize the evidence for 37 proposed origins of mobile resistance genes. Using state-of-the-art genomic analyses, we supplement and evaluate the evidence based on well-defined criteria. Nineteen percent of reported origins did not fulfill the criteria to confidently assign the respective origin. Of the curated origin taxa, {\textgreater}90{\%} have been associated with infection in humans or domestic animals, some taxa being the origin of several different resistance genes. The clinical emergence of these resistance genes appears to be a consequence of antibiotic selection pressure on taxa that are permanently or transiently associated with the human/domestic animal microbiome.},

PCR amplicons containing new integrase genes, intI, linked with novel gene cassettes, were recovered and had sizes from 1.8 to 2.5 kb. This approach uncovered, for the first time, the structure and diversity of both marine integron attachment site, attI, and the first gene cassette, the most efficiently expressed integron-associated gene cassette. The recovered 13 and 20 intI phylotypes, from Suez and Tokyo Bay samples, respectively, showed a highly divergence, suggesting a difference in integron composition between the sampling sites. Some intI phylotypes showed similarity with that from Geobacter metallireducens, belonging to Deltaproteobacteria, the dominant class in both sampling sites, as determined by 16S rRNA gene analysis. Thirty distinct families of putative attI site, as determined by the presence of an attI-like simple site, were recovered. A total of 146 and 68 gene cassettes represented Suez and Tokyo Bay unsaturated cassette pools, respectively. Gene cassettes, including a first cassette, from both sampling sites encoded two novel families of glyoxalase/bleomycin antibiotic-resistance protein. Gene cassettes from Suez Bay encoded proteins similar to haloacid dehalogenases, protein disulfide isomerases and death-on-curing and plasmid maintenance system killer proteins. First gene cassettes from Tokyo Bay encoded a xenobiotic-degrading protein, cardiolipin synthetase, esterase and WD40-like \textgreek{b} propeller protein. Many of the first gene cassettes encoded proteins with no ascribable function but some of them were duplicated and possessed signal functional sites, suggesting efficient adaptive functions to their bacterial sources. Thus, each sampling site had a specific profile of integrons and cassette types consistent with the hypothesis that the environment shapes the genome.},

 abstract = {Members of the ATP-binding cassette F (ABC-F) proteins confer resistance to several classes of clinically important antibiotics through ribosome protection. Recent structures of two ABC-F proteins, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MsrE and Bacillus subtilis VmlR bound to ribosome have shed light onto the ribosome protection mechanism whereby drug resistance is mediated by the antibiotic resistance domain (ARD) connecting the two ATP binding domains. ARD of the E site bound MsrE and VmlR extends toward the drug binding region within the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) and leads to conformational changes in the P site tRNA acceptor stem, the PTC, and the drug binding site causing the release of corresponding drugs. The structural similarities and differences of the MsrE and VmlR structures likely highlight an universal ribosome protection mechanism employed by antibiotic resistance (ARE) ABC-F proteins. The variable ARD domains enable this family of proteins to adapt the protection mechanism for several classes of ribosome-targeting drugs. ARE ABC-F genes have been found in numerous pathogen genomes and multi-drug resistance conferring plasmids. Collectively they mediate resistance to a broader range of antimicrobial agents than any other group of resistance proteins and play a major role in clinically significant drug resistance in pathogenic bacteria. Here, we review the recent structural and biochemical findings on these emerging resistance proteins, offering an update of the molecular basis and implications for overcoming ABC-F conferred drug resistance.},

Identification of microorganisms and the genes involved in the biodegradation of BACs is crucial for better understanding the fate of BACs in the environment and developing treatment strategies. Four microbial communities degrading BACs were developed from sewage (SEW), activated sludge (AS), soil (SOIL) and sea sediment (SEA) samples. According to 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and shotgun metagenome sequencing analyses, the most abundant species represented uncharacterized members of the Pseudomonas and Achromobacter genera. BAC biotransformation rates of the enriched microbial communities were 2.8, 3.2, 17.8, and 24.3 \textgreek{m}M hr(-1) for SEA, AS, SOIL, and SEW, respectively, and were positively correlated with the relative abundance of a particular Pseudomonas sp. strain, BIOMIG1. The strain BIOMIG1 mineralizes BACs at a rate up to 2.40 \textgreek{m}mol hr(-1) 10(-11) cells. Genomes of four BAC degrading and nondegrading BIOMIG1 phenotypes were sequenced and differentially compared with each other. As a result, a gene cluster encoding for transporters, an integrase and a dioxygenase were involved in BAC biotransformation. Our results suggest that BIOMIG1 plays a key role on the fate of BACs in the environment and genes, other than those reported to date, are involved in BAC biotransformation in various habitats.},

AMC in both sectors, expressed in mg/kg of estimated biomass, were compared at country and European level. Substantial variations between countries were observed in both sectors. Estimated data on AMC for pigs and poultry were used for the first time. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied to study associations between AMC~and AMR. In 2014, the average AMC was higher in animals (152~mg/kg) than in humans (124~mg/kg), but the opposite applied to the median AMC (67 and 118~mg/kg, respectively). In 18 of 28 countries, AMC was lower in animals than in humans. Univariate analysis showed statistically-significant (p~{\textless}~0.05) associations between AMC and AMR for fluoroquinolones and Escherichia~coli in both sectors, for 3rd- and 4th-generation cephalosporins and E.~coli in humans, and tetracyclines and polymyxins and E.~coli in animals. In humans, there was a statistically-significant association between AMC and AMR for carbapenems and polymyxins in Klebsiella~pneumoniae. Consumption of macrolides in animals was significantly associated with macrolide resistance in Campylobacter~coli in animals and humans. Multivariate analyses provided a unique approach to assess the contributions of AMC in humans and animals and AMR in bacteria from animals to AMR in bacteria from humans. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that 3rd- and 4th-generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone resistance in E.~coli from humans was associated with corresponding AMC in humans, whereas resistance to fluoroquinolones in Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. from humans was related to consumption of fluoroquinolones in animals. These results suggest that from a 'One-health' perspective, there is potential in both sectors to further develop prudent use of antimicrobials and thereby reduce AMR.},

Fast and accurate quality control is essential for studies involving next-generation sequencing data. Whilst numerous tools exist to quantify QC metrics, there is no common approach to flexibly integrate these across tools and large sample sets. Assessing analysis results across an entire project can be time consuming and error prone; batch effects and outlier samples can easily be missed in the early stages of analysis.

RESULTS

We present MultiQC, a tool to create a single report visualising output from multiple tools across many samples, enabling global trends and biases to be quickly identified. MultiQC can plot data from many common bioinformatics tools and is built to allow easy extension and customization.

To develop real-time PCR assays for tracking and tracing clostridia responsible for human botulism.

METHODS AND RESULTS

Real-time PCR assays based on the detection of the genes ntnh encoding the nontoxin-nonhaemagglutinin (NTNH) proteins or the most homologous regions of the botulinum neurotoxin (bont) genes have been developed together with four real-time PCR assays, each being specific of the genes bont/A, bont/B, bont/E, bont/F and enables a toxin type-specific identification. The specificity of the assays was demonstrated using a panel of botulinum toxin producing clostridia (29 strains), nonbotulinum toxin producing clostridia (21 strains) and various other bacterial strains. The toxin type-specific assays had a sensitivity of 100 fg-1000 fg of total DNA in the PCR tube (25-250 genome equivalents) which correspond to 10(3) to 10(4) cells ml(-1). After a 48 h enrichment in anaerobic conditions, these PCR assays allowed the detection of Clostridium botulinum type A in a naturally contaminated sample of 'foie gras' suspected in a C. botulinum outbreak.

CONCLUSION

These PCR tests are specific and reliable for detection of heterogeneous BoNT producing clostridia responsible for human botulism.

SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY

Adoption of these PCR assays is a step forward a reliable and rapid detection of these clostridia in food samples.},

Since those compounds inhibit bacterial growth, it was thought that they should be produced by soil microorganisms to inhibit the growth of competitors in natural habitats. It has been shown however that antibiotics modulate transcription of bacteria in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, each antibiotic triggers a specific response, and those responses may have adaptive values. From these observations, it has been suggested that antibiotics may have a role as signalling molecules besides inhibitors. The facts that a number of antimicrobials not used for therapy (like lantibiotics) are involved in quorum sensing and that classical quorum sensing autoinducers have antimicrobial activity further support this dual role for antibiotics.},

The datasets were derived using Illumina high-throughput sequencing and were based on BLAST against self-established databases of BDGs, DDT degradation genes (DDGs), HCH degradation genes (HDGs), and ATZ degradation genes (ADGs). The results showed that the abundance and diversity of BDGs, DDGs, HDGs, and ADGs varied with sample source and locations. The lip and mnp genes, which encode for peroxidase, and the carA gene, which encodes for laccase, were detected as the dominant genes for degradation of organic pollutants. The hdt, hdg, and atzB genes, which encode for hydratase, dehalogenase, and ethylaminohydrolase, were found to be the most abundant genes involved in DDT, HCH, and ATZ degradation, respectively. The identified 69 genera capable of degrading organic pollutants were mostly affiliated with Proteobacteria (49.3{\%}) and Actinobacteria (21.7{\%}). Four genera, including Plesiocystis, Anaerolinea, Jannaschia, and Mycobacterium, were the major biodegradation populations in all sediments. In this study, the nearly complete biodegradation pathways of DDT and ATZ were found, and the partial degradation pathway of HCH was detected in all sediments.},

The results showed that the degradation half-life of atrazine obviously decreased with increased treatment frequency. Soil microbial functional diversity displayed a variation trend of suppression-recovery-stimulation, which was associated with increased degradation rate of atrazine. 16S amplicon sequencing was conducted to explore bacterial community structure and correlate the genus to potential atrazine degradation. A total of seven potentially atrazine-degrading bacterial genera were found including Nocardioides, Arthrobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Burkholderia, Methylobacterium, Mycobacterium, and Clostridium. These bacterial genera showed almost complete atrazine degradation pathways including dechlorination, dealkylation, hydroxylation, and ring cleavage. Furthermore, the relative abundance of four of them (i.e., Nocardioides, Arthrobacter, Methylobacterium, and Bradyrhizobium) increased with treatment frequency and atrazine concentration, suggesting that they may participate in atrazine degradation during repeated treatments. Our findings reveal the potential relationship between atrazine degradation and soil bacterial community structure in repeatedly treated soils.},

Phages and plasmids are the major components of mobile genetic elements, and fragments from such elements generally co-exist with chromosome-derived fragments in sequenced metagenomic data. However, there is a lack of efficient methods that can simultaneously identify phages and plasmids in metagenomic data, and the existing tools identifying either phages or plasmids have not yet presented satisfactory performance.

FINDINGS

We present PPR-Meta, a 3-class classifier that allows simultaneous identification of both phage and plasmid fragments from metagenomic assemblies. PPR-Meta consists of several modules for predicting sequences of different lengths. Using deep learning, a novel network architecture, referred to as the Bi-path Convolutional Neural Network, is designed to improve the performance for short fragments. PPR-Meta demonstrates much better performance than currently available similar tools individually for phage or plasmid identification, while testing on both artificial contigs and real metagenomic data. PPR-Meta is freely available via http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/ZhuLab/PPR{\_}Meta or https://github.com/zhenchengfang/PPR-Meta.

CONCLUSIONS

To the best of our knowledge, PPR-Meta is the first tool that can simultaneously identify phage and plasmid fragments efficiently and reliably. The software is optimized and can be easily run on a local PC by non-computer professionals. We developed PPR-Meta to promote the research on mobile genetic elements and horizontal gene transfer.},

Many tools for dealing with compositional ` 'omics' data produce feature-wise values that can be ranked in order to describe features' associations with some sort of variation. These values include differentials (which describe features' associations with specified covariates) and feature loadings (which describe features' associations with variation along a given axis in a biplot). Although prior work has discussed the use of these `rankings' as a starting point for exploring the log-ratios of particularly high- or low-ranked features, such exploratory analyses have previously been done using custom code to visualize feature rankings and the log-ratios of interest. This approach is laborious, prone to errors and raises questions about reproducibility. To address these problems we introduce Qurro, a tool that interactively visualizes a plot of feature rankings (a `rank plot') alongside a plot of selected features' log-ratios within samples (a `sample plot'). Qurro's interface includes various controls that allow users to select features from along the rank plot to compute a log-ratio; this action updates both the rank plot (through highlighting selected features) and the sample plot (through displaying the current log-ratios of samples). Here, we demonstrate how this unique interface helps users explore feature rankings and log-ratios simply and effectively.},

With the rise of affordable whole genome sequencing, in silico approaches to assessing AMR gene content can be used to detect known resistance mechanisms and potentially identify novel mechanisms. To enable accurate assessment of AMR gene content, as part of a multi-agency collaboration, NCBI developed a comprehensive AMR gene database, the Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance Reference Gene Database and the AMR gene detection tool AMRFinder. Here, we describe the expansion of the Reference Gene Database, now called the Reference Gene Catalog, to include putative acid, biocide, metal, stress resistance genes, in addition to virulence genes and species-specific point mutations. Genes and point mutations are classified by broad functions, as well as more detailed functions. As we have expanded both the functional repertoire of identified genes and functionality, NCBI released a new version of AMRFinder, known as AMRFinderPlus. This new tool allows users the option to utilize only the core set of AMR elements, or include stress response and virulence genes, too. AMRFinderPlus can detect acquired genes and point mutations in both protein and nucleotide sequence. In addition, the evidence used to identify the gene has been expanded to include whether nucleotide or protein sequence was used, its location in the contig, and presence of an internal stop codon. These database improvements and functional expansions will enable increased precision in identifying AMR genes, linking AMR genotypes and phenotypes, and determining possible relationships between AMR, virulence, and stress response.},

 abstract = {Background: Experimental designs that take advantage of high-throughput sequencing to generate datasets include RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments, metagenomic analysis and selective growth experiments. In each case the underlying data are similar and are composed of counts of sequencing reads mapped to a large number of features in each sample. Despite this underlying similarity, the data analysis methods used for these experimental designs are all different, and do not translate across experiments. Alternative methods have been developed in the physical and geological sciences that treat similar data as compositions. Compositional data analysis methods transform the data to relative abundances with the result that the analyses are more robust and reproducible.

Results: Data from an in vitro selective growth experiment, an RNA-seq experiment and the Human Microbiome Project 16S rRNA gene abundance dataset were examined by ALDEx2, a compositional data analysis tool that uses Bayesian methods to infer technical and statistical error. The ALDEx2 approach is shown to be suitable for all three types of data: it correctly identifies both the direction and differential abundance of features in the differential growth experiment, it identifies a substantially similar set of differentially expressed genes in the RNA-seq dataset as the leading tools and it identifies as differential the taxa that distinguish the tongue dorsum and buccal mucosa in the Human Microbiome Project dataset. The design of ALDEx2 reduces the number of false positive identifications that result from datasets composed of many features in few samples.

Conclusion: Statistical analysis of high-throughput sequencing datasets composed of per feature counts showed that the ALDEx2 R package is a simple and robust tool, which can be applied to RNA-seq, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and differential growth datasets, and by extension to other techniques that use a similar approach.},

 abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, is known to cause multidrug resistant infections. This organism has primarily been isolated from clinical environments and its environmental reservoirs remain largely unknown. In the present study, we recovered seven isolates of A. baumannii growing under conditions selective for Campylobacter spp. (microaerophilic at 42°C and in the presence of antibiotics) from dairy cattle manure storage tank or surface water impacted by livestock effluents. Antibiotic susceptibility tests revealed that all of these isolates were less susceptible to at least two different clinically relevant antibiotics, compared to the type strain A. baumannii ATCC17978. Expression of resistance-nodulation-division efflux pumps, an important mechanism of intrinsic resistance in these organisms, was analyzed, and adeB was found to be overexpressed in one and adeJ was overexpressed in three isolates. Comparison of these isolates using genomic DNA Macro-Restriction Fragment Pattern Analysis (MRFPA) revealed relatively low relatedness among themselves or with some of the clinical isolates from previous studies. This study suggests that A. baumannii isolates are capable of growing under selective conditions for Campylobacter spp. and that this organism can be present in manure and water.},

Using a high-throughput functional metagenomic approach in conjunction with a pipeline for the de novo assembly of short-read sequence data from functional selections (termed PARFuMS), we provide evidence for recent exchange of antibiotic resistance genes between environmental bacteria and clinical pathogens. We describe multidrug-resistant soil bacteria containing resistance cassettes against five classes of antibiotics (\textgreek{b}-lactams, aminoglycosides, amphenicols, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines) that have perfect nucleotide identity to genes from diverse human pathogens. This identity encompasses noncoding regions as well as multiple mobilization sequences, offering not only evidence of lateral exchange but also a mechanism by which antibiotic resistance disseminates.},

 abstract = {Ancient and diverse antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have previously been identified from soil, including genes identical to those in human pathogens. Despite the apparent overlap between soil and clinical resistomes, factors influencing ARG composition in soil and their movement between genomes and habitats remain largely unknown. General metagenome functions often correlate with the underlying structure of bacterial communities. However, ARGs are proposed to be highly mobile, prompting speculation that resistomes may not correlate with phylogenetic signatures or ecological divisions. To investigate these relationships, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 18 antibiotics from 18 agricultural and grassland soils. The 2,895 ARGs we discovered were mostly new, and represent all major resistance mechanisms. We demonstrate that distinct soil types harbour distinct resistomes, and that the addition of nitrogen fertilizer strongly influenced soil ARG content. Resistome composition also correlated with microbial phylogenetic and taxonomic structure, both across and within soil types. Consistent with this strong correlation, mobility elements (genes responsible for horizontal gene transfer between bacteria such as transposases and integrases) syntenic with ARGs were rare in soil by comparison with sequenced pathogens, suggesting that ARGs may not transfer between soil bacteria as readily as is observed between human pathogens. Together, our results indicate that bacterial community composition is the primary determinant of soil ARG content, challenging previous hypotheses that horizontal gene transfer effectively decouples resistomes from phylogeny.},

Relative to pure translated search, HUMAnN2 is faster and produces more accurate gene family profiles. We applied HUMAnN2 to study clinal variation in marine metabolism, ecological contribution patterns among human microbiome pathways, variation in species' genomic versus transcriptional contributions, and strain profiling. Further, we introduce 'contributional diversity' to explain patterns of ecological assembly across different microbial community types.},

CD-HIT is a widely used program for clustering biological sequences to reduce sequence redundancy and improve the performance of other sequence analyses. In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to $\sim$24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to $\sim$8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.

 abstract = {Macrolide resistance mechanisms can be target-based with a change in a 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) residue or a mutation in ribosomal protein L4 or L22 affecting the ribosome's interaction with the antibiotic. Alternatively, mono- or dimethylation of A2058 in domain V of the 23S rRNA by an acquired rRNA methyltransferase, the product of an erm (erythromycin ribosome methylation) gene, can interfere with antibiotic binding. Acquired genes encoding efflux pumps, most predominantly mef(A) + msr(D) in pneumococci/streptococci and msr(A/B) in staphylococci, also mediate resistance. Drug-inactivating mechanisms include phosphorylation of the 2'-hydroxyl of the amino sugar found at position C5 by phosphotransferases and hydrolysis of the macrocyclic lactone by esterases. These acquired genes are regulated by either translation or transcription attenuation, largely because cells are less fit when these genes, especially the rRNA methyltransferases, are highly induced or constitutively expressed. The induction of gene expression is cleverly tied to the mechanism of action of macrolides, relying on antibiotic-bound ribosomes stalled at specific sequences of nascent polypeptides to promote transcription or translation of downstream sequences.},

 abstract = {The use of heavy metals in economic and social development can create an accumulation of toxic waste in the environment. High concentrations of heavy metals can damage human and animal health, lead to the development of antibiotic resistance, and possibly change in bovine microbiota. It is important to investigate the influence of heavy metals in food systems to determine potential harmful effects environmental heavy metal contamination on human health. Because of a mining dam rupture, 43 million cubic meters of iron ore waste flowed into the Doce river basin surrounding Mariana City, Brazil, in 2015. Following this environmental disaster, we investigated the consequences of long-term exposure to contaminated drinking water on the microbiome and resistome of dairy cattle. We identified bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in the feces, rumen fluid, and nasopharynx of 16 dairy cattle 4 years after the environmental disaster. Cattle had been continuously exposed to heavy metal contaminated water until sample collection (A) and compared them to analogous samples from 16 dairy cattle in an unaffected farm, 356 km away (B). The microbiome and resistome of farm A and farm B differed in many aspects. The distribution of genes present in the cattle's nasopharynx, rumen, and feces conferring AMR was highly heterogeneous, and most genes were present in only a few samples. The relative abundance and prevalence (presence/absence) of AMR genes were higher in farm A than in farm B. Samples from farm A had a higher prevalence (presence) of genes conferring resistance to multiple drugs, metals, biocides, and multi-compound resistance. Fecal samples had a higher relative abundance of AMR genes, followed by rumen fluid samples, and the nasopharynx had the lowest relative abundance of AMR genes detected. Metagenome functional annotation suggested that selective pressures of heavy metal exposure potentially skewed pathway diversity toward fewer, more specialized functions. This is the first study that evaluates the consequences of a Brazilian environmental accident with mining ore dam failure in the microbiome of dairy cows. Our findings suggest that the long-term persistence of heavy metals in the environment may result in differences in the microbiota and enrichment of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Our results also suggest that AMR genes are most readily detected in fecal samples compared to rumen and nasopharyngeal samples which had relatively lower bacterial read counts. Since heavy metal contamination has an effect on the animal microbiome, environmental management is warranted to protect the food system from hazardous consequences.},

We developed a novel high-throughput amplicon sequencing pipeline that enables characterization of thousands of integron gene cassette-associated reads, and applied it to acquire a comprehensive overview of gene cassette composition in effluents from wastewater treatment facilities across Europe. Between 38 100 and 172 995 reads per-sample were generated and functionally characterized by screening against nr, SEED, ARDB and \textgreek{b}-lactamase databases. Over 75{\%} of the reads were characterized as hypothetical, but thousands were associated with toxin-antitoxin systems, DNA repair, cell membrane function, detoxification and aminoglycoside and \textgreek{b}-lactam resistance. Among the reads characterized as \textgreek{b}-lactamases, the carbapenemase blaOXA was dominant in most of the effluents, except for Cyprus and Israel where blaGES was also abundant. Quantitative PCR assessment of blaOXA and blaGES genes in the European effluents revealed similar trends to those displayed in the integron amplicon sequencing pipeline described above, corroborating the robustness of this method and suggesting that these integron-associated genes may be excellent targets for source tracking of effluents in downstream environments. Further application of the above analyses revealed several order-of-magnitude reductions in effluent-associated \textgreek{b}-lactamase genes in effluent-saturated soils, suggesting marginal persistence in the soil microbiome.},

In such graphs, confidence ellipses would allow testing significant differences between groups of samples. Multivariate statistical tests such as permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) can be performed on distance matrices calculated from richness and evenness coordinates and detect statistically significant differences that would have remained unforeseen otherwise.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the effect of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point.

RESULTS

Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported in the litterature for untreated patients. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination.

CONCLUSION

Despite its small sample size, our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.},

 abstract = {The impact of human activity on the selection for antibiotic resistance in the environment is largely unknown, although considerable amounts of antibiotics are introduced through domestic wastewater and farm animal waste. Selection for resistance may occur by exposure to antibiotic residues or by co-selection for mobile genetic elements (MGEs) which carry genes of varying activity. Class 1 integrons are genetic elements that carry antibiotic and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) resistance genes that confer resistance to detergents and biocides. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and diversity of class 1 integron and integron-associated QAC resistance genes in bacteria associated with industrial waste, sewage sludge and pig slurry. We show that prevalence of class 1 integrons is higher in bacteria exposed to detergents and/or antibiotic residues, specifically in sewage sludge and pig slurry compared with agricultural soils to which these waste products are amended. We also show that QAC resistance genes are more prevalent in the presence of detergents. Studies of class 1 integron prevalence in sewage sludge amended soil showed measurable differences compared with controls. Insertion sequence elements were discovered in integrons from QAC contaminated sediment, acting as powerful promoters likely to upregulate cassette gene expression. On the basis of this data, {\textgreater}1 $\times$ 10(19) bacteria carrying class 1 integrons enter the United Kingdom environment by disposal of sewage sludge each year.},

 abstract = {A critical component of bacterial pathogenesis is the ability of an invading organism to sense and adapt to the harsh environment imposed by the host's immune system. This is especially important for opportunistic pathogens, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, a nutritionally versatile environmental organism that has recently gained attention as a life-threatening human pathogen. The emergence of A. baumannii is closely linked to antibiotic resistance, and many contemporary isolates are multidrug resistant (MDR). Unlike many other MDR pathogens, the molecular mechanisms underlying A. baumannii pathogenesis remain largely unknown. We report here the characterization of two recently identified virulence determinants, GigA and GigB, which comprise a signal transduction pathway required for surviving environmental stresses, causing infection and antibiotic resistance. Through transcriptome analysis, we show that GigA and GigB coordinately regulate the expression of many genes and are required for generating an appropriate transcriptional response during antibiotic exposure. Genetic and biochemical data demonstrate a direct link between GigA and GigB and the nitrogen phosphotransferase system (PTSNtr), establishing a novel connection between a novel stress response module and a well-conserved metabolic-sensing pathway. Based on the results presented here, we propose that GigA and GigB are master regulators of a global stress response in A. baumannii, and coupling this pathway with the PTSNtr allows A. baumannii to integrate cellular metabolic status with external environmental cues.IMPORTANCE Opportunistic pathogens, including Acinetobacter baumannii, encounter many harsh environments during the infection cycle, including antibiotic exposure and the hostile environment within a host. While the development of antibiotic resistance in A. baumannii has been well studied, how this organism senses and responds to environmental cues remain largely unknown. Herein, we investigate two previously identified virulence determinants, GigA and GigB, and report that they are required for in vitro stress resistance, likely comprising upstream elements of a global stress response pathway. Additional experiments identify a connection between GigA/GigB and a widely conserved metabolic-sensing pathway, the nitrogen phosphotransferase system. We propose that coordination of these two pathways allows A. baumannii to respond appropriately to changing environmental conditions, including those encountered during infection.},

 abstract = {Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are among the most commonly used disinfectants. There has been concern that their widespread use will lead to the development of resistant organisms, and it has been suggested that limits should be place on their use. While increases in tolerance to QACs have been observed, there is no clear evidence to support the development of resistance to QACs. Since efflux pumps are believe to account for at least some of the increased tolerance found in bacteria, there has been concern that this will enhance the resistance of bacteria to certain antibiotics. QACs are membrane-active agents interacting with the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and lipids of viruses. The wide variety of chemical structures possible has seen an evolution in their effectiveness and expansion of applications over the last century, including non-lipid-containing viruses (i.e., noroviruses). Selection of formulations and methods of application have been shown to affect the efficacy of QACs. While numerous laboratory studies on the efficacy of QACs are available, relatively few studies have been conducted to assess their efficacy in practice. Better standardized tests for assessing and defining the differences between increases in tolerance versus resistance are needed. The ecological dynamics of microbial communities where QACs are a main line of defense against exposure to pathogens need to be better understood in terms of sublethal doses and antibiotic resistance.},

 abstract = {Class 1 integrons have played a major role in the global dissemination of antibiotic resistance. Reconstructing the history of class 1 integrons might help us control further spread of antibiotic resistance by understanding how human activities influence microbial evolution. Here we describe a class 1 integron that represents an intermediate stage in the evolutionary history of clinical integrons. It was embedded in a series of nested transposons, carried on an IncP plasmid resident in Enterobacter, isolated from the surface of baby spinach leaves. Based on the structure of this integron, we present a modified hypothesis for integron assembly, where the ancestral clinical class 1 integron was captured from a betaproteobacterial chromosome to form a Tn402-like transposon. This transposon then inserted into a plasmid-borne Tn21-like ancestor while in an environmental setting, possibly a bacterium resident in the phyllosphere. We suggest that the qacE gene cassette, conferring resistance to biocides, together with the mercury resistance operon carried by Tn21, provided a selective advantage when this bacterium made its way into the human commensal flora via food. The integron characterized here was located in Tn6007, which along with Tn6008, forms part of the larger Tn6006 transposon, itself inserted into another transposable element to form the Tn21-like transposon, Tn6005. This element has previously been described from the human microbiota, but with a promoter mutation that upregulates integron cassette expression. This element we describe here is from an environmental bacterium, and supports the hypothesis that the ancestral class 1 integron migrated into anthropogenic settings via foodstuffs. Selection pressures brought about by early antimicrobial agents, including mercury, arsenic and disinfectants, promoted its initial fixation, the acquisition of promoter mutations, and subsequent dissemination into various species and pathogens.},

To address this question, we sequenced integron gene cassettes from soils sampled across Australia and Antarctica. We recovered 44 970 open reading frames that encoded 27 215 unique proteins, representing an order of magnitude more cassettes than previous sequencing efforts. We found that cassettes have extremely high local richness, significantly greater than previously predicted, with estimates ranging from 4000 to 18 000 unique cassettes per 0.3 g of soil. We show that cassettes have a heterogeneous distribution across space, and that they exhibit rapid turnover with distance. Similarity between samples drops to between 0.1{\%} and 10{\%} at distances of as little as 100 m.

 abstract = {Acinetobacter species are emerging as major nosocomial pathogens, aided by their ability to acquire resistance to all classes of antibiotics. A key factor leading to their multi-drug resistance phenotypes is the acquisition of a wide variety of mobile genetic elements, particularly large conjugative plasmids. Here, we characterize a family of 21 multi-drug resistance mega-plasmids in 11 different Acinetobacter species isolated from various locations across the globe. The plasmid family exhibits a highly dynamic and diverse accessory genome, including 221 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that confer resistance to 13 classes of antibiotics. We show that plasmids isolated within the same geographic region are often evolutionarily divergent members of this family based on their core-genome, yet they exhibit a more similar accessory genome. Individual plasmids, therefore, can disseminate to different locations around the globe, where they then appear to acquire diverse sets of accessory genes from their local surroundings. Further, we show that plasmids from several geographic regions were enriched with location-specific functional traits. Together, our findings show that these mega-plasmids can transmit across species boundaries, have the capacity for global dissemination, can accumulate a diverse suite of location-specific accessory genes, and can confer multi-drug resistance phenotypes of significant concern for human health. We therefore highlight this previously undescribed plasmid family as a serious threat to healthcare systems worldwide. These findings also add to the growing concern that mega-plasmids are key disseminators of antibiotic resistance and require global surveillance.},

Chronic inflammation of the airways accompanied by infiltration by neutrophils and overproduction of mucus and pro-inflammatory cytokines is observed in bronchial asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), DPB, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis. The airways of these patients are often colonised by mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa attached to epithelium by a biofilm. Bacteria intercommunicate for biofilm formation by a system of lactones known as quorum sensing. Macrolides inhibit mobility and quorum sensing of P. aeruginosa; they also decrease production of mucus by epithelial cells and biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines from monocytes and epithelial cells by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappaB. Large, randomised clinical trials for the management of these disorders with macrolides are not available, with the sole exception of four trials denoting benefit following long-term administration of azithromycin in patients with CF. That benefit is consistent with an increase in forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)) and a decrease in the rate of bacterial exacerbations. Studies with small numbers of patients with COPD revealed attenuation of the inflammatory reaction by macrolides. Experimental studies of Gram-negative sepsis have shown considerable attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response following intravenous administration of clarithromycin. Results of the effects of clarithromycin in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and sepsis in a large, randomised study of 200 patients are awaited.},

While antibiotic resistance in human pathogens continues to rise at alarming rates, the impact of environmental resistance on human health is still unclear. To investigate the relationship between human-associated and environmental resistomes, we analyzed functional metagenomic selections for resistance against 18 clinically relevant antibiotics from soil and human gut microbiota as well as a set of multidrug-resistant cultured soil isolates. These analyses were enabled by Resfams, a new curated database of protein families and associated highly precise and accurate profile hidden Markov models, confirmed for antibiotic resistance function and organized by ontology. We demonstrate that the antibiotic resistance functions that give rise to the resistance profiles observed in environmental and human-associated microbial communities significantly differ between ecologies. Antibiotic resistance functions that most discriminate between ecologies provide resistance to \textgreek{b}-lactams and tetracyclines, two of the most widely used classes of antibiotics in the clinic and agriculture. We also analyzed the antibiotic resistance gene composition of over 6000 sequenced microbial genomes, revealing significant enrichment of resistance functions by both ecology and phylogeny. Together, our results indicate that environmental and human-associated microbial communities harbor distinct resistance genes, suggesting that antibiotic resistance functions are largely constrained by ecology.},

We aimed to identify a natural environment where such exchanges might occur, and determine the phylogenetic range of participating integrons. Here we examine freshwater biofilms and show that families of cassettes conferring resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (qac) are found on class 1 integrons identical to those from clinical contexts, on sequence variants of class 1 integrons only known from natural environments, and on other diverse classes of integrons only known from the chromosomes of soil and freshwater Proteobacteria. We conclude that gene cassettes might be readily shared between different integron classes found in environmental, commensal and pathogenic bacteria. This suggests that class 1 integrons in pathogens have access to a vast pool of gene cassettes, any of which could confer a phenotype of clinical relevance.

They have spread into over 70 bacterial species of medical importance, are commonly resident in the gut of humans and domesticated animals, and have invaded every continent, including Antarctica. They have done so via linkage with transposons, metal, disinfectant and antibiotic resistance genes.

 abstract = {PURPOSE

The ability to properly analyze and interpret large microbiome data sets has lagged behind our ability to acquire such data sets from environmental or clinical samples. Sequencing instruments impose a structure on these data: the natural sample space of a 16S rRNA gene sequencing data set is a simplex, which is a part of real space that is restricted to nonnegative values with a constant sum. Such data are compositional and should be analyzed using compositionally appropriate tools and approaches. However, most of the tools for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis assume these data are unrestricted.

METHODS

We show that existing tools for compositional data (CoDa) analysis can be readily adapted to analyze high-throughput sequencing data sets.

RESULTS

The Human Microbiome Project tongue versus buccal mucosa data set shows how the CoDa approach can address the major elements of microbiome analysis. Reanalysis of a publicly available autism microbiome data set shows that the CoDa approach in concert with multiple hypothesis test corrections prevent false positive identifications.

CONCLUSIONS

The CoDa approach is readily scalable to microbiome-sized analyses. We provide example code and make recommendations to improve the analysis and reporting of microbiome data sets.},

Average daily loads in untreated wastewater correlated well with those estimated from annual consumption data and pharmacokinetic behavior. Considerable variations were found during a day, and seasonal differences seem to occur for the macrolides, probably caused by a higher consumption of these substances in winter. The most predominant macrolide and sulfonamide antimicrobials were clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole, respectively. In the case of sulfamethoxazole, the main human metabolite, N4-acetylsulfamethoxazole, was included as an analyte, accounting for up to 86{\%} of the total load in untreated wastewater. The results obtained illustrate the importance of considering retransformable substances, for example human metabolites, when investigating the behavior and fate of pharmaceuticals. Average concentrations of sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, azithromycin, and clarithromycin in activated sludge ranged between 28 and 68 microg/kg of dry weight. Overall the sorption to activated sludge was shown to be low for the investigated antimicrobials, with estimated sorption constants for activated sludge below 500 L/kg. Elimination in activated sludge treatment was found to be incomplete for all investigated compounds. In final effluents, the median concentrations for sulfamethoxazole and clarithromycin were 290 and 240 ng/L, respectively.},

Primary treatment provided no significant elimination for the investigated substances. Similar eliminations were observed in the secondary treatment of two conventional activated sludge (CAS) systems and a fixed-bed reactor (FBR). Sulfamethoxazole, including the fraction present as N4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole, was eliminated by approximately 60{\%} in comparison to about 80{\%} in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) independently of the solid retention time (SRT), indicating a positive correlation of the observed elimination to the organic substrate concentration. The elimination for macrolides and trimethoprim varied significantly between the different sampling campaigns in the two CAS systems and in the FBR. In the MBR, these analytes were eliminated up to 50{\%} at SRT of 16+/-2 and 33+/-3 d. Trimethoprim, clarithromycin and dehydro-erythromycin showed a higher elimination of up to 90{\%} at a SRT of 60-80 d indicating a correlation with reduced substrate loading (SL). Together with the high SRT, the SL may lead to an increased biodiversity of the active biomass, resulting in a broader range of degradation pathways available. Two investigated sand filters showed different elimination behavior. One led to a significant elimination of most macrolides (17-23{\%}) and trimethoprim (74+/-14{\%}), while no elimination was observed in the other sand filter investigated.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Bacteriophages (phages) are the most numerous biological entities on Earth and play a crucial role in shaping microbial communities. Investigating the bacteriophage community from soil will shed light not only on the yet largely unknown phage diversity, but may also result in novel insights towards their functioning in the global biogeochemical nutrient cycle and their significance in earthbound ecosystems. Unfortunately, information about soil viromes is rather scarce compared to aquatic environments, due to the heterogeneous soil matrix, which rises major technical difficulties in the extraction process. Resolving these technical challenges and establishing a standardized extraction protocol is, therefore, a fundamental prerequisite for replicable results and comparative virome studies.

RESULTS

We here report the optimization of protocols for the extraction of phage DNA from agricultural soil preceding metagenomic analysis such that the protocol can equally be harnessed for phage isolation. As an optimization strategy, soil samples were spiked with Listeria phage A511 (Myovirus), Staphylococcus phage 2638A\textgreek{D}LCR (Siphovirus) and Escherichia phage T7 (Podovirus) (each 106 PFU/g soil). The efficacy of phage (i) elution, (ii) filtration, (iii) concentration and (iv) DNA extraction methods was tested. Successful extraction routes were selected based on spiked phage recovery and low bacterial 16S rRNA gene contaminants. Natural agricultural soil viromes were then extracted with the optimized methods and shotgun sequenced. Our approach yielded sufficient amounts of inhibitor-free viral DNA for shotgun sequencing devoid of amplification prior library preparation, and low 16S rRNA gene contamination levels ($\leq$ 0.2‰). Compared to previously published protocols, the number of bacterial read contamination was decreased by 65{\%}. In addition, 379 novel putative complete soil phage genomes ($\leq$ 235 kb) were obtained from over 13,000 manually identified viral contigs, promising the discovery of a large, previously inaccessible viral diversity.

CONCLUSION

We have shown a considerably enhanced extraction of the soil phage community by protocol optimization that has proven robust in both culture-dependent as well as through viromic analyses. Our huge data set of manually curated soil viral contigs substantially increases the amount of currently available soil virome data, and provides insights into the yet largely undescribed soil viral sequence space.},

The median arsenic concentration in the surface agricultural soils of China was 10.40~mg~Kg-1, and it ranged from 0.4~mg~Kg-1 to 175.8~mg~Kg-1. The inventory of arsenic in Chinese agricultural surface soils was estimated to be 3.71~$\times$~106~t.

However, the role of antibiotic pollution in selection and transferability of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is still limited. In this study, we analyzed effluents from azithromycin-synthesis and veterinary-drug formulation facilities as well as sediments from receiving river and creek taken at the effluent discharge sites, upstream and downstream of discharge. Culturing showed that the effluent discharge significantly increased the proportion of antibiotic resistant bacteria in exposed sediments compared to the upstream ones. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that effluents from both industries contained high and similar relative abundances of resistance genes [sul1, sul2, qacE/qacE\textgreek{D}1, tet(A)], class 1 integrons (intI1) and IncP-1 plasmids (korB). Consequently, these genes significantly increased in relative abundances in receiving sediments, with more pronounced effects being observed for river than for creek sediments due to lower background levels of the investigated genes in the river. In addition, effluent discharge considerably increased transfer frequencies of captured ARGs from exposed sediments into Escherichia coli CV601 recipient as shown by biparental mating experiments. Most plasmids exogenously captured from effluent and polluted sediments belonged to the broad host range IncP-1\textgreek{e} plasmid group, conferred multiple antibiotic resistance and harbored class 1 integrons. Discharge of pharmaceutical waste from antibiotic manufacturing sites thus poses a risk for development and dissemination of multi-resistant bacteria, including pathogens.},

With this new method, we were able to perform a hybrid error correction of the nanopore reads using complementary MiSeq data and produce a de novo assembly that is highly contiguous and accurate: The contig N50 length is more than ten times greater than an Illumina-only assembly (678 kb versus 59.9 kbp) and has {\textgreater}99.88{\%} consensus identity when compared to the reference. Furthermore, the assembly with the long nanopore reads presents a much more complete representation of the features of the genome and correctly assembles gene cassettes, rRNAs, transposable elements, and other genomic features that were almost entirely absent in the Illumina-only assembly.},

We utilized a new sequencing kit that combines DNA extraction with PCR amplification of a large region of the rRNA operon and downstream bioinformatic data analysis. Longitudinal microbiome samples of coadmitted twins from two different neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) were analyzed using an $\sim$2,500-base amplicon that spans the 16S and 23S rRNA genes and mapped to a new, custom 16S-23S rRNA database. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) inferred using DADA2 provided sufficient resolution for the differentiation of rRNA variants from closely related but not previously sequenced Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter strains, among the first bacteria colonizing the gut of these infants after admission to the NICU. Distinct ASV groups (fingerprints) were monitored between coadmitted twins over time, demonstrating the potential to track the source and spread of both commensals and pathogens. The high-resolution taxonomy obtained from long amplicon sequencing enables the tracking of strains temporally and spatially as microbiomes are established in infants in the hospital environment.IMPORTANCE Achieving strain-level resolution is a major obstacle for source tracking and temporal studies of microbiomes. In this study, we describe a novel deep-sequencing approach that provides species- and strain-level resolution of the neonatal microbiome. Using Klebsiella, E. coli, and Enterobacter as examples, we could monitor their temporal dynamics after antibiotic treatment and in pairs of twins. The strain-level resolution, combined with the greater sequencing depth and decreased cost per read of PacBio Sequel 2, enables this advantageous source- and strain-tracking analysis method to be implemented widely across more complex microbiomes.},

For evidence-based outbreak investigations fast and reliable techniques and procedures are required to identify the source of infection. Metagenomics has the potential to become a powerful tool in the field of modern food safety, since it allows the detection, identification and characterization of a broad range of pathogens in a single experiment without pre-cultivation within a couple of days. Nevertheless, sample handling, sequencing and data analysis are challenging and can introduce errors and biases into the analysis. In order to evaluate the potential of metagenomics in food safety, we generated a mock community containing DNA of foodborne bacteria. Herewith, we compare the aptitude of the two prevalent approaches - 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and whole genome shotgun sequencing - for the detection of foodborne bacteria using different parameters during sample preparation, sequencing and data analysis. 16S rDNA sequencing did not only result in high deviations from the expected sample composition on genus and species level, but more importantly lacked the detection of several pathogenic species. While shotgun sequencing is more suitable for species detection, abundance estimation, genome assembly and species characterization, the performance can vary depending on the library preparation kit, which was confirmed for a naturally Francisella tularensis contaminated game meat sample. The application of the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit for shotgun sequencing did not only result in lower reference genome recovery and coverage, but also in distortions of the mock community composition. For data analysis, we propose a publicly available workflow for pathogen detection and characterization and demonstrate its benefits on the usability of metagenomic sequencing in food safety by analyzing an authentic metagenomic sample.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Burkholderia cenocepacia is recognized as opportunistic pathogen that can cause lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. A hallmark of B. cenocepacia infections is the inability to eradicate the organism because of multiple intrinsic antibiotic resistance. As Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) efflux systems are responsible for much of the intrinsic multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, this study aims to identify RND genes in the B. cenocepacia genome and start to investigate their involvement into antimicrobial resistance.

RESULTS

Genome analysis and homology searches revealed 14 open reading frames encoding putative drug efflux pumps belonging to RND family in B. cenocepacia J2315 strain. By reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis, it was found that orf3, orf9, orf11, and orf13 were expressed at detectable levels, while orf10 appeared to be weakly expressed in B. cenocepacia. Futhermore, orf3 was strongly induced by chloramphenicol. The orf2 conferred resistance to fluoroquinolones, tetraphenylphosphonium, streptomycin, and ethidium bromide when cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli KAM3, a strain lacking the multidrug efflux pump AcrAB. The orf2-overexpressing E. coli also accumulate low concentrations of ethidium bromide, which was restored to wild type level in the presence of CCCP, an energy uncoupler altering the energy of the drug efflux pump.

CONCLUSION

The 14 RND pumps gene we have identified in the genome of B. cenocepacia suggest that active efflux could be a major mechanism underlying antimicrobial resistance in this microorganism. We have characterized the ORF2 pump, one of these 14 potential RND efflux systems. Its overexpression in E. coli conferred resistance to several antibiotics and to ethidium bromide but it remains to be determined if this pump play a significant role in the antimicrobial intrinsic resistance of B. cenocepacia. The characterization of antibiotic efflux pumps in B. cenocepacia is an obligatory step prior to the design of specific, potent bacterial inhibitors for the improved control of infectious diseases. Consequently, the topic deserves to be further investigated and future studies will involve systematic investigation on the function and expression of each of the RND efflux pump homologs.},

Current methods to study antibiotic resistance in various environments rely on extensive deep sequencing or laborious culturing of fastidious organisms, both of which are heavily time-consuming operations. An accurate and sensitive method to identify both rare and common resistance elements in complex metagenomic samples is needed. Referencing the sequences in the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database, we designed a set of 37,826 probes to specifically target over 2,000 nucleotide sequences associated with antibiotic resistance in clinically relevant bacteria. Testing of this probe set on DNA libraries generated from multidrug-resistant bacteria to selectively capture resistance genes reproducibly produced higher numbers of reads on target at a greater length of coverage than shotgun sequencing. We also identified additional resistance gene sequences from human gut microbiome samples that sequencing alone was not able to detect. Our method to capture the resistome enables a sensitive means of gene detection in diverse environments where genes encoding antibiotic resistance represent less than 0.1{\%} of the metagenome.},

All AR genetic determinants were collected from published works and online resources; nucleotide and protein sequences were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank database. After building a database that includes 1,689 antibiotic resistance genes, the software was tested in a blind manner using 100 random sequences selected from the database to verify that the sensitivity and specificity were at 100{\%} even when partial sequences were queried. Notably, BLAST analysis results obtained using the rmtF gene sequence (a new aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme gene sequence that is not included in the database) as a query revealed that the tool was able to link this sequence to short sequences (17 to 40 bp) found in other genes of the rmt family with significant E values. Finally, the analysis of 178 Acinetobacter baumannii and 20 Staphylococcus aureus genomes allowed the detection of a significantly higher number of AR genes than the Resfinder gene analyzer and 11 point mutations in target genes known to be associated with AR. The average time for the analysis of a genome was 3.35 $\pm$ 0.13 min. We have created a concise database for BLAST using a Bio-Edit interface that can detect AR genetic determinants in bacterial genomes and can rapidly and easily discover putative new AR genetic determinants.},

Limitations of genome sequencing techniques have led to dozens of assembly algorithms, none of which is perfect. A number of methods for comparing assemblers have been developed, but none is yet a recognized benchmark. Further, most existing methods for comparing assemblies are only applicable to new assemblies of finished genomes; the problem of evaluating assemblies of previously unsequenced species has not been adequately considered. Here, we present QUAST-a quality assessment tool for evaluating and comparing genome assemblies. This tool improves on leading assembly comparison software with new ideas and quality metrics. QUAST can evaluate assemblies both with a reference genome, as well as without a reference. QUAST produces many reports, summary tables and plots to help scientists in their research and in their publications. In this study, we used QUAST to compare several genome assemblers on three datasets. QUAST tables and plots for all of them are available in the Supplementary Material, and interactive versions of these reports are on the QUAST website.

Manure was collected from antibiotic-free dairy cattle (DC) or antibiotic-treated dairy cattle (DA), with a portion composted for parallel comparison. Amendments were applied to loamy sand or silty clay loam, and lettuce and radishes were cultivated to maturity in a greenhouse. Metagenomes were profiled via shotgun Illumina sequencing. Radishes carried a distinct ARG composition compared to that of lettuce, with greater relative abundance of total ARGs. Taxonomic species richness was also greater for radishes by 1.5-fold. The resistomes of lettuce grown with DC compost were distinct from those grown with DA compost, DC manure, or fertilizer only. Further, compost applied to loamy sand resulted in twofold-greater relative abundance of total ARGs on lettuce than when applied to silty clay loam. The resistomes of radishes grown with biological amendments were distinct from the corresponding fertilizer controls, but effects of composting or antibiotic use were not measureable. Cultivation in loamy sand resulted in higher species richness for both lettuce and radishes than when grown in silty clay loam by 2.2-fold and 1.2-fold, respectively, when amended with compost.IMPORTANCE A controlled, integrated, and replicated greenhouse study, along with comprehensive metagenomic analysis, revealed that multiple preharvest factors, including antibiotic use during manure collection, composting, biological soil amendment, and soil type, influence vegetable-borne resistomes. Here, radishes, a root vegetable, carried a greater load of ARGs and species richness than lettuce, a leafy vegetable. However, the lettuce resistome was more noticeably influenced by upstream antibiotic use and composting. Network analysis indicated that cooccurring ARGs and mobile genetic elements were almost exclusively associated with conditions receiving raw manure amendments, suggesting that composting could alleviate the mobility of manure-derived resistance traits. Effects of preharvest factors on associated microbiota and resistomes of vegetables eaten raw are worthy of further examination in terms of potential influence on human microbiomes and spread of antibiotic resistance. This research takes a step toward identifying on-farm management practices that can help mitigate the spread of agricultural sources of antibiotic resistance.},

Bacterial beta diversity, determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, bifurcated according to soil texture (P {\textless} 0.001, R = 0.501). There was a striking cross-effect in which raw manure from antibiotic-treated and antibiotic-free beef and dairy cattle added to loamy sand (LS) elevated relative (16S rRNA gene-normalized) (by 0.9 to 1.9 log10) and absolute (per-radish) (by 1.1 to 3.0 log10) abundances of intI1 (an integrase gene and indicator of mobile multiantibiotic resistance) on radishes at harvest compared to chemical fertilizer-only control conditions (P {\textless} 0.001). Radishes tended to carry fewer copies of intI1 and sul1 when grown in silty clay loam than LS. Composting reduced relative abundance of intI1 on LS-grown radishes (0.6 to 2.4 log10 decrease versus corresponding raw manure; P {\textless} 0.001). Effects of antibiotic use were rarely discernible. Heterotrophic plate count bacteria capable of growth on media containing tetracycline, vancomycin, sulfamethazine, or erythromycin tended to increase on radishes grown in turned composted antibiotic-treated dairy or beef control (no antibiotics) manures relative to the corresponding raw manure in LS (0.8- to 2.3-log10 increase; P {\textless} 0.001), suggesting that composting sometimes enriches cultivable bacteria with phenotypic resistance. This study demonstrates that combined effects of soil texture and manure-based amendments influence the microbiota of radish surfaces and markers of antibiotic resistance, illuminating future research directions for reducing agricultural sources of antibiotic resistance.IMPORTANCE In working toward a comprehensive strategy to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance, potential farm-to-fork routes of dissemination are gaining attention. The effects of preharvest factors on the microbiota and corresponding antibiotic resistance indicators on the surfaces of produce commonly eaten raw is of special interest. Here, we conducted a controlled greenhouse study, using radishes as a root vegetable grown in direct contact with soil, and compared the effects of manure-based soil amendments, antibiotic use in the cattle from which the manure was sourced, composting of the manure, and soil texture, with chemical fertilizer only as a control. We noted significant effects of amendment type and soil texture on the composition of the microbiota and genes used as indicators of antibiotic resistance on radish surfaces. The findings take a step toward identifying agricultural practices that aid in reducing carriage of antibiotic resistance and corresponding risks to consumers.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Shotgun metagenomics is increasingly used to characterise microbial communities, particularly for the investigation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in different animal and environmental contexts. There are many different approaches for inferring the taxonomic composition and AMR gene content of complex community samples from shotgun metagenomic data, but there has been little work establishing the optimum sequencing depth, data processing and analysis methods for these samples. In this study we used shotgun metagenomics and sequencing of cultured isolates from the same samples to address these issues. We sampled three potential environmental AMR gene reservoirs (pig caeca, river sediment, effluent) and sequenced samples with shotgun metagenomics at high depth ({\~{}} 200 million reads per sample). Alongside this, we cultured single-colony isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the same samples and used hybrid sequencing (short- and long-reads) to create high-quality assemblies for comparison to the metagenomic data. To automate data processing, we developed an open-source software pipeline, 'ResPipe'.

RESULTS

Taxonomic profiling was much more stable to sequencing depth than AMR gene content. 1 million reads per sample was sufficient to achieve {\textless} 1{\%} dissimilarity to the full taxonomic composition. However, at least 80 million reads per sample were required to recover the full richness of different AMR gene families present in the sample, and additional allelic diversity of AMR genes was still being discovered in effluent at 200 million reads per sample. Normalising the number of reads mapping to AMR genes using gene length and an exogenous spike of Thermus thermophilus DNA substantially changed the estimated gene abundance distributions. While the majority of genomic content from cultured isolates from effluent was recoverable using shotgun metagenomics, this was not the case for pig caeca or river sediment.

CONCLUSIONS

Sequencing depth and profiling method can critically affect the profiling of polymicrobial animal and environmental samples with shotgun metagenomics. Both sequencing of cultured isolates and shotgun metagenomics can recover substantial diversity that is not identified using the other methods. Particular consideration is required when inferring AMR gene content or presence by mapping metagenomic reads to a database.

 abstract = {MOTIVATION

Sequence analyses oriented to investigate specific features, patterns and functions of protein and DNA/RNA sequences usually require tools based on graphic interfaces whose main characteristic is their intuitiveness and interactivity with the user's expertise, especially when curation or primer design tasks are required. However, interface-based tools usually pose certain computational limitations when managing large sequences or complex datasets, such as genome and transcriptome assemblies. Having these requirments in mind we have developed SeqEditor an interactive software tool for nucleotide and protein sequences' analysis.

RESULT

SeqEditor is a cross-platform desktop application for the analysis of nucleotide and protein sequences. It is managed through a Graphical User Interface and can work either as a graphical sequence browser or as a fasta task manager for multi-fasta files. SeqEditor has been optimized for the management of large sequences, such as contigs, scaffolds or even chromosomes, and includes a GTF/GFF viewer to visualize and manage annotation files. In turn, this allows for content mining from reference genomes and transcriptomes with similar efficiency to that of command line tools. SeqEditor also incorporates a set of tools for singleplex and multiplex PCR primer design and pooling that uses a newly optimized and validated search strategy for target and species-specific primers. All these features make SeqEditor a flexible application that can be used to analyses complex sequences, design primers in PCR assays oriented for diagnosis, and/or manage, edit and personalize reference sequence datasets.

AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION

SeqEditor was developed in Java using Eclipse Rich Client Platform and is publicly available at https://gpro.biotechvana.com/download/SeqEditor as binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac OS. The user manual and tutorials are available online at https://gpro.biotechvana.com/tool/seqeditor/manual.

 abstract = {Carriage of resistance genes can underpin bacterial survival, and by spreading these genes between species, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) can potentially protect diversity within microbial communities. The spread of MGEs could be affected by environmental factors such as selection for resistance, and biological factors such as plasmid host range, with consequences for individual species and for community structure. Here we cultured a focal bacterial strain, Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25, embedded within a soil microbial community, with and without mercury selection, and with and without mercury resistance plasmids (pQBR57 or pQBR103), to investigate the effects of selection and resistance gene introduction on (1) the focal species; (2) the community as a whole; (3) the spread of the introduced mer resistance operon. We found that P. fluorescens SBW25 only escaped competitive exclusion by other members of community under mercury selection, even when it did not begin with a mercury resistance plasmid, due to its propensity to acquire resistance from the community by horizontal gene transfer. Mercury pollution had a significant effect on community structure, decreasing alpha diversity within communities while increasing beta diversity between communities, a pattern that was not affected by the introduction of mercury resistance plasmids by P. fluorescens SBW25. Nevertheless, the introduced merA gene spread to a phylogenetically diverse set of recipients over the 5 weeks of the experiment, as assessed by epicPCR. Our data demonstrates how the effects of MGEs can be experimentally assessed for individual lineages, the wider community, and for the spread of adaptive traits.},

The activities of neutral phosphatase (NPA) and catalase (CAT) displayed the suppression-recovery-stimulation trend in the OM{\&}CTC treatment but the stimulation trend in the OM{\&}CTC{\&}CIP treatment. The NPA was stimulated but the CAT was little affected in the OM{\&}CIP treatment. Soil microbial functional diversity displayed the suppression-recovery-stimulation trend in the OM{\&}CTC and OM{\&}CTC{\&}CIP treatments and the stimulation-suppression trend in the OM{\&}CIP treatment with the treatment frequency. Metagenomic analysis showed that the relative abundances of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes in the antibiotic treatment significantly increased by 0.5-235.6{\%}, but that of Proteobacteria decreased by 0.2-27.3{\%} compared to the control with the treatment frequency. Furthermore, the relative abundances of dominant bacterial genera including Streptomyces, Actinomadura, Mycobacterium, and Streptococcus in the antibiotic treatment significantly increased by 1.1-10433.3{\%} compared to the control. Meanwhile, repeated antibiotic treatments induced a significant increase in the diversity and resistance level of ARB isolates, especially in the OM{\&}CTC treatment. It is concluded that repeated treatments with CTC and/or CIP can alter enzyme activities, microbial community structure and function, and increase the diversity and resistance level of ARB isolates.},

Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) have been used worldwide as common disinfectants and detergents; however, their potential impact on the spread and diffusion of ARGs is still unknown. In this study, we detected the QAC resistance gene (qacE\textgreek{D}1), the 1 integron gene (intI1), and 12 ARGs (sul1, sul2, cfr, cml, fexA, tetA, tetG, tetQ, tetX, ermB, blaTEM, and dfrA1) in 48 water samples from three watersheds by quantitative PCR (qPCR). We investigated the evolution of bacterial antibiotic resistance under QAC and antibiotic environmental pressures by long-term continuous culture. In addition, five QACs were selected to investigate the effect of QAC on the efficiency of conjugation transfer. The changes in bacterial cell membrane and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by flow cytometry, revealing the mechanism by which QAC affects the spread of antibiotic resistance. Our results showed that the QAC resistance gene was ubiquitous in watersheds and it had significant correlation with intI1 and seven ARGs (r = 0.999, p {\textless} 0.01). QACs could increase the resistance of bacteria to multiple antibiotics. Furthermore, all five QACs promoted the conjugation transfer of the RP4 plasmid; the optimal concentration of QACs was about 10-1-10-2~mg/L and their transfer efficiencies were between 1.33 $\times$ 10-6 and 8.87 $\times$ 10-5. QACs enhanced membrane permeability of bacterial cells and stimulated bacteria to produce ROS, which potentially promoted the transfer of plasmids between bacteria. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that QACs may facilitate the evolution and gene transfer of antibiotic resistance gene among microbiome.},

@article{Harmer.2014,
 abstract = {The insertion sequence IS26 plays a key role in disseminating antibiotic resistance genes in Gram-negative bacteria, forming regions containing more than one antibiotic resistance gene that are flanked by and interspersed with copies of IS26. A model presented for a second mode of IS26 movement that explains the structure of these regions involves a translocatable unit consisting of a unique DNA segment carrying an antibiotic resistance (or other) gene and a single IS copy. Structures resembling class I transposons are generated via RecA-independent incorporation of a translocatable unit next to a second IS26 such that the ISs are in direct orientation. Repeating this process would lead to arrays of resistance genes with directly oriented copies of IS26 at each end and between each unique segment. This model requires that IS26 recognizes another IS26 as a target, and in transposition experiments, the frequency of cointegrate formation was 60-fold higher when the target plasmid contained IS26. This reaction was conservative, with no additional IS26 or target site duplication generated, and orientation specific as the IS26s in the cointegrates were always in the same orientation. Consequently, the cointegrates were identical to those formed via the known mode of IS26 movement when a target IS26 was not present. Intact transposase genes in both IS26s were required for high-frequency cointegrate formation as inactivation of either one reduced the frequency 30-fold. However, the IS26 target specificity was retained. Conversion of each residue in the DDE motif of the Tnp26 transposase also reduced the cointegration frequency. Importance: Resistance to antibiotics belonging to several of the different classes used to treat infections is a critical problem. Multiply antibiotic-resistant bacteria usually carry large regions containing several antibiotic resistance genes, and in Gram-negative bacteria, IS26 is often seen in these clusters. A model to explain the unusual structure of regions containing multiple IS26 copies, each associated with a resistance gene, was not available, and the mechanism of their formation was unexplored. IS26-flanked structures deceptively resemble class I transposons, but this work reveals that the features of IS26 movement do not resemble those of the IS and class I transposons studied to date. IS26 uses a novel movement mechanism that defines a new family of mobile genetic elements that we have called {\textquotedbl}translocatable units.{\textquotedbl} The IS26 mechanism also explains the properties of IS257 (IS431) and IS1216, which belong to the same IS family and mobilize resistance genes in Gram-positive staphylococci and enterococci.},

@article{Harmer.2016,
 abstract = {The IS26 transposase, Tnp26, catalyzes IS26 movement to a new site and deletion or inversion of adjacent DNA via a replicative route. The intramolecular deletion reaction produces a circular molecule consisting of a DNA segment and a single IS26, which we call a translocatable unit or TU. Recently, Tnp26 was shown to catalyze an additional intermolecular, conservative reaction between two preexisting copies of IS26 in different plasmids. Here, we have investigated the relative contributions of homologous recombination and Tnp26-catalyzed reactions to the generation of a transposon from a TU. Circular TUs containing the aphA1a kanamycin and neomycin resistance gene or the tet(D) tetracycline resistance determinant were generated in vitro and transformed into Escherichia coli recA cells carrying R388::IS26. The TU incorporated next to the IS26 in R388::IS26 forms a transposon with the insertion sequence (IS) in direct orientation. Introduction of a second TU produced regions containing both the aphA1a gene and the tet(D) determinant in either order but with only three copies of IS26. The integration reaction, which required a preexisting IS26, was precise and conservative and was 50-fold more efficient when both IS26 copies could produce an active Tnp26. When both ISs were inactivated by a frameshift in tnp26, TU incorporation was not detected in E.~coli recA cells, but it did occur in E.~coli recA (+) cells. However, the Tnp-catalyzed reaction was 100-fold more efficient than RecA-dependent homologous recombination. The ability of Tnp26 to function in either a replicative or conservative mode is likely to explain the prominence of IS26-bounded transposons in the resistance regions found in Gram-negative bacteria. IMPORTANCE In Gram-negative bacteria, IS26 recruits antibiotic resistance genes into the mobile gene pool by forming transposons carrying many different resistance genes. In addition to replicative transposition, IS26 was recently shown to use a novel conservative movement mechanism in which an incoming IS26 targets a preexisting one. Here, we have demonstrated how IS26-bounded class I transposons can be produced from translocatable units (TUs) containing only an IS26 and a resistance gene via the conservative reaction. TUs were incorporated next to an existing IS26, creating a class I transposon, and if the targeted IS26 is in a transposon, the product resembles two transposons sharing a central IS26, a configuration observed in some resistance regions and when a transposon is tandemly duplicated. Though homologous recombination could also incorporate a TU, Tnp26 is far more efficient. This provides insight into how IS26 builds transposons and brings additional transposons into resistance regions.},

The antimicrobial resistance of clinical, environmental and control strains of the WHO {\textquotedbl}Priority 1: Critical group{\textquotedbl} organisms, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to various classes of antibiotics, colistin and surfactin (biosurfactant) was determined.

METHODS

Acinetobacter baumannii was isolated from environmental samples and antibiotic resistance profiling was performed to classify the test organisms [A. baumannii (n~= 6), P. aeruginosa (n~= 5), E. coli (n~= 7) and K. pneumoniae (n~= 7)] as multidrug resistant (MDR) or extreme drug resistant (XDR). All the bacterial isolates (n~= 25) were screened for colistin resistance and the mobilised colistin resistance (mcr) genes. Biosurfactants produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ST34 were solvent extracted and characterised using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The susceptibility of strains, exhibiting antibiotic and colistin resistance, to the crude surfactin extract (cell-free supernatant) was then determined.

RESULTS

Antibiotic resistance profiling classified four A. baumannii (67{\%}), one K. pneumoniae (15{\%}) and one P. aeruginosa (20{\%}) isolate as XDR, with one E. coli (15{\%}) and three K. pneumoniae (43{\%}) strains classified as MDR. Many of the isolates [A. baumannii (25{\%}), E. coli (80{\%}), K. pneumoniae (100{\%}) and P. aeruginosa (100{\%})] exhibited colistin resistance [minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) $\geq$ 4 mg/L]; however, only one E. coli strain isolated from a clinical environment harboured the mcr-1 gene. UPLC-MS analysis then indicated that the B. amyloliquefaciens ST34 produced C13-16 surfactin analogues, which were identified as Srf1 to Srf5. The crude surfactin extract (10.00 mg/mL) retained antimicrobial activity (100{\%}) against the MDR, XDR and colistin resistant A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains.

CONCLUSION

Clinical, environmental and control strains of A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, E. coli and K. pneumoniae exhibiting MDR and XDR profiles and colistin resistance, were susceptible to surfactin analogues, confirming that this lipopeptide shows promise for application in clinical settings.},

 abstract = {UNLABELLED

Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), which are resistant to most or all known antibiotics, constitute a global threat to public health. Transposable elements are often associated with antibiotic resistance determinants, suggesting a role in the emergence of resistance. One insertion sequence, IS26, is frequently associated with resistance determinants, but its role remains unclear. We have analyzed the genomic contexts of 70 IS26 copies in several clinical and surveillance CPE isolates from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. We used target site duplications and their patterns as guides and found that a large fraction of plasmid reorganizations result from IS26 replicative transpositions, including replicon fusions, DNA inversions, and deletions. Replicative transposition could also be inferred for transposon Tn4401, which harbors the carbapenemase blaKPC gene. Thus, replicative transposition is important in the ongoing reorganization of plasmids carrying multidrug-resistant determinants, an observation that carries substantial clinical and epidemiological implications for understanding how such extreme drug resistance phenotypes evolve.

IMPORTANCE

Although IS26 is frequently reported to reside in resistance plasmids of clinical isolates, the characteristic hallmark of transposition, target site duplication (TSD), is generally not observed, raising questions about the mode of transposition for IS26. The previous observation of cointegrate formation during transposition implies that IS26 transposes via a replicative mechanism. The other possible outcome of replicative transposition is DNA inversion or deletion, when transposition occurs intramolecularly, and this would also generate a specific TSD pattern that might also serve as supporting evidence for the transposition mechanism. The numerous examples we present here demonstrate that replicative transposition, used by many mobile elements (including IS26 and Tn4401), is prevalent in the plasmids of clinical isolates and results in significant plasmid reorganization. This study also provides a method to trace the evolution of resistance plasmids based on TSD patterns.},

Rapid increase of the data size in metagenome researches has raised the demand for new tools to process large datasets efficiently. To accelerate the metagenome profiling process in the scenario of big data, we developed SOAPMetaS, a marker gene-based multiple-sample metagenome profiling tool built on Apache Spark. SOAPMetaS demonstrates high performance and scalability to process large datasets. It can process 80 samples of FASTQ data, summing up to 416 GiB, in around half an hour; and the accuracy of species profiling results of SOAPMetaS is similar to that of MetaPhlAn2. SOAPMetaS can deal with a large volume of metagenome data more efficiently than common-used single-machine tools.

Development of resistance in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria has been related to application in human medicine and the food industry. QACs in cosmetic products will inevitably come into intimate contact with the skin or mucosal linings in the mouth and thus are likely to add to the selection pressure toward more QAC-resistant microorganisms among the skin or mouth flora. There is increasing evidence of coresistance and cross-resistance between QACs and a range of other clinically important antibiotics and disinfectants. Use of QACs may have driven the fixation and spread of certain resistance cassette collectors (class 1 integrons), currently responsible for a major part of antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria. More indiscriminate use of QACs such as in cosmetic products may drive the selection of further new genetic elements that will aid in the persistence and spread of antimicrobial resistance and thus in limiting our treatment options for microbial infections.},

 abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious threat to global public health, but obtaining representative data on AMR for healthy human populations is difficult. Here, we use metagenomic analysis of untreated sewage to characterize the bacterial resistome from 79 sites in 60 countries. We find systematic differences in abundance and diversity of AMR genes between Europe/North-America/Oceania and Africa/Asia/South-America. Antimicrobial use data and bacterial taxonomy only explains a minor part of the AMR variation that we observe. We find no evidence for cross-selection between antimicrobial classes, or for effect of air travel between sites. However, AMR gene abundance strongly correlates with socio-economic, health and environmental factors, which we use to predict AMR gene abundances in all countries in the world. Our findings suggest that global AMR gene diversity and abundance vary by region, and that improving sanitation and health could potentially limit the global burden of AMR. We propose metagenomic analysis of sewage as an ethically acceptable and economically feasible approach for continuous global surveillance and prediction of AMR.},

 abstract = {Several interconnected human, animal and environmental habitats can contribute to the emergence, evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance, and the health of these contiguous habitats (the focus of the One Health approach) may represent a risk to human health. Additionally, the expansion of resistant clones and antibiotic resistance determinants among human-associated, animal-associated and environmental microbiomes have the potential to alter bacterial population genetics at local and global levels, thereby modifying the structure, and eventually the productivity, of microbiomes where antibiotic-resistant bacteria can expand. Conversely, any change in these habitats (including pollution by antibiotics or by antibiotic-resistant organisms) may influence the structures of their associated bacterial populations, which might affect the spread of antibiotic resistance to, and among, the above-mentioned microbiomes. Besides local transmission among connected habitats-the focus of studies under the One Health concept-the transmission of resistant microorganisms might occur on a broader (even worldwide) scale, requiring coordinated Global Health actions. This Review provides updated information on the elements involved in the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance at local and global levels, and proposes studies to be performed and strategies to be followed that may help reduce the burden of antibiotic resistance as well as its impact on human and planetary health.},

Typhimurium virulence plasmid pSLT, was evaluated. Adscription to the group was based on detection of the bla(OXA-1) gene (encoding ampicillin resistance) by PCR, and identification of a pUO-StVR plasmid through hybridization with specific probes for virulence (spvC) and resistance (bla(OXA-1)) genes. In this way, 57 out of 134 ampicillin-resistant clinical isolates of S. Typhimurium, collected over 2002-2004 in 21 Spanish cities, were assigned to the group, which can be already regarded as endemic. Most isolates ({\textgreater}89{\%}) shared the following features: (i) resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin/spectinomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline, encoded by bla(OXA-1)-catA1-aadA1-sul1-tet(B); (ii) a class 1 integron (InH) with the bla(OXA-1)-aadA1 gene cassettes within its variable region of ca. 2000bp; (iii) the spvC, rck, samA, oriT, traT, traX, repA (RepFIIA), and parA/B genes (but not rsk and pefABCD) of pSLT; (iv) a hybrid plasmid of ca. 125kb, termed pUO-StVR2, where the resistance and virulence genes are located. However, intra-group diversity was also detected, since a total of four resistance phenotypes, five resistance genotypes, two integron profiles, five plasmid variants (pUO-StVR2, 4-7, differing in size, restriction profile and/or resistance pattern), 15 XbaI-BlnI combined macrorestriction profiles, and five phage types were identified. Each hybrid plasmid was revealed as a distinctive BlnI band, through hybridization with pUO-StVR2. The genetic markers used, together with the knowledge generated in the present study, could be applied to epidemiological surveillance of S. Typhimurium pUO-StVR worldwide.},

Fifty IncP-1\textgreek{e} plasmids that were captured in E. coli CV601gfp from bacterial communities of manure and arable soil were characterized by PCR and hybridization. All plasmids carried class 1 integrons with highly varying sizes of the gene cassette region and the sul1 gene.

The backbones were nearly identical to that of the previously described IncP-1\textgreek{e} plasmid pKJK5.

One recent hypothesis is that bacteria present in soil will be protected from acute toxic effects of QAACs in the presence of expandable layer silicates due to interlayer sorption. We therefore studied bacterial growth kinetics with high temporal resolution and determined minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of two QAACs, benzyldimethyldodecylammonium chloride (BAC-C12) and didecyldimethylammonium~chlorid (DADMAC-C10), for eight strains of different bacterial taxa (Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas fluorescens) in relation to QAAC sorption to smectite and kaolinite. The MICs of BAC-C12 and DADMAC-C10 were in the absence of smectite and kaolinite in the order of 10 to 30~µg~mL-1 and 1.0 to 3.5~µg~mL-1 for all strains except the more sensitive Acinetobacter strain. For all tested strains and both tested QAACs, the presence of smectite increased apparent MIC values while kaolinite had no effect on MICs. Sorption curves without bacteria showed that smectite sorbed larger amounts of QAACs than kaolinite. Correcting nominal QAAC concentrations employed in toxicity tests for QAAC sorption using the sorption curves explained well the observed shifts in apparent MICs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that the interlayer space of smectite expanded from 13.7 $\pm$ 1~{\AA} to 19.9 $\pm$ 1.5~{\AA} after addition of BAC-C12. This study provides first evidence that low charge 2:1 expandable layer silicates can play an important role for buffering QAAC toxicity in soils.},

Conveniently, a 549-567-bp segment of the cpn60 coding region can be amplified with universal PCR primers. Here, we introduce cpnDB, a curated collection of cpn60 sequence data collected from public databases or generated by a network of collaborators exploiting the cpn60 target in clinical, phylogenetic, and microbial ecology studies. The growing database currently contains approximately 2000 records covering over 240 genera of bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea. The database also contains over 60 sequences for the archaeal Type II chaperonin (thermosome, a homolog of eukaryotic cytoplasmic chaperonin) from 19 archaeal genera. As the largest curated collection of sequences available for a protein-encoding gene, cpnDB provides a resource for researchers interested in exploiting the power of cpn60 as a diagnostic or as a target for phylogenetic or microbial ecology studies, as well as those interested in broader subjects such as lateral gene transfer and codon usage.

The BoNTs are exoneurotoxins that can cause severe paralysis and death in humans and other animal species. A collection of 174 C. botulinum strains was examined by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis and by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and BoNT genes to examine the genetic diversity within this species. This collection contained representatives of each of the seven different serotypes of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT/A to BoNT/G). Analysis of the16S rRNA gene sequences confirmed previous identifications of at least four distinct genomic backgrounds (groups I to IV), each of which has independently acquired one or more BoNT genes through horizontal gene transfer. AFLP analysis provided higher resolution and could be used to further subdivide the four groups into subgroups. Sequencing of the BoNT genes from multiple strains of serotypes A, B, and E confirmed significant sequence variation within each serotype. Four distinct lineages within each of the BoNT A and B serotypes and five distinct lineages of serotype E strains were identified. The nucleotide sequences of the seven toxin genes of the serotypes were compared and showed various degrees of interrelatedness and recombination, as was previously noted for the nontoxic nonhemagglutinin gene, which is linked to the BoNT gene. These analyses contribute to the understanding of the evolution and phylogeny within this species and assist in the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for the treatment of botulism.},

@article{Hirano.2019,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Co-occurrence networks-ecological associations between sampled populations of microbial communities inferred from taxonomic composition data obtained from high-throughput sequencing techniques-are widely used in microbial ecology. Several co-occurrence network methods have been proposed. Co-occurrence network methods only infer ecological associations and are often used to discuss species interactions. However, validity of this application of co-occurrence network methods is currently debated. In particular, they simply evaluate using parametric statistical models, even though microbial compositions are determined through population dynamics.

RESULTS

We comprehensively evaluated the validity of common methods for inferring microbial ecological networks through realistic simulations. We evaluated how correctly nine widely used methods describe interaction patterns in ecological communities. Contrary to previous studies, the performance of the co-occurrence network methods on compositional data was almost equal to or less than that of classical methods (e.g., Pearson's correlation). The methods described the interaction patterns in dense and/or heterogeneous networks rather inadequately. Co-occurrence network performance also depended upon interaction types; specifically, the interaction patterns in competitive communities were relatively accurately predicted while those in predator-prey (parasitic) communities were relatively inadequately predicted.

CONCLUSIONS

Our findings indicated that co-occurrence network approaches may be insufficient in interpreting species interactions in microbiome studies. However, the results do not diminish the importance of these approaches. Rather, they highlight the need for further careful evaluation of the validity of these much-used methods and the development of more suitable methods for inferring microbial ecological networks.},

 abstract = {Public transit systems are ideal for studying the urban microbiome and interindividual community transfer. In this study, we used 16S amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to profile microbial communities on multiple transit surfaces across train lines and stations in the Boston metropolitan transit system. The greatest determinant of microbial community structure was the transit surface type. In contrast, little variation was observed between geographically distinct train lines and stations serving different demographics. All surfaces were dominated by human skin and oral commensals such as Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus. The detected taxa not associated with humans included generalists from alphaproteobacteria, which were especially abundant on outdoor touchscreens. Shotgun metagenomics further identified viral and eukaryotic microbes, including Propionibacterium phage and Malassezia globosa. Functional profiling showed that Propionibacterium acnes pathways such as propionate production and porphyrin synthesis were enriched on train holding surfaces (holds), while electron transport chain components for aerobic respiration were enriched on touchscreens and seats. Lastly, the transit environment was not found to be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. Our results suggest that microbial communities on transit surfaces are maintained from a metapopulation of human skin commensals and environmental generalists, with enrichments corresponding to local interactions with the human body and environmental exposures. IMPORTANCE Mass transit environments, specifically, urban subways, are distinct microbial environments with high occupant densities, diversities, and turnovers, and they are thus especially relevant to public health. Despite this, only three culture-independent subway studies have been performed, all since 2013 and all with widely differing designs and conclusions. In this study, we profiled the Boston subway system, which provides 238 million trips per year overseen by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). This yielded the first high-precision microbial survey of a variety of surfaces, ridership environments, and microbiological functions (including tests for potential pathogenicity) in a mass transit environment. Characterizing microbial profiles for multiple transit systems will become increasingly important for biosurveillance of antibiotic resistance genes or pathogens, which can be early indicators for outbreak or sanitation events. Understanding how human contact, materials, and the environment affect microbial profiles may eventually allow us to rationally design public spaces to sustain our health in the presence of microbial reservoirs.

In this study, lignocellulose-degrading microorganisms were inoculated at two levels (uninoculated control = 0{\%}, and T treatment = 10{\%}) during co-composting of swine manure with spent mushroom substrate, and their effects on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and the bacterial community were investigated. Inoculation with lignocellulose-degrading microorganisms caused greater decreases in 6/11 ARGs and 3/4 mobile genetic elements than the control. The total relative abundances of ARGs increased by 0.23 logs in the control but decreased by 0.08 logs in the T treatment after co-composting. The bacterial community was clustered according to the composting time in the two treatments, where inoculation mainly affected the bacterial community during the mesophilic phase. Redundancy analysis and network analysis showed that the bacterial community succession had important effects on the variations in ARGs. Inoculation with lignocellulose-degrading microorganisms led to the reduction of ARGs, which was significantly correlated with the abundances of potential host bacteria for ARGs. Thus, inoculation with lignocellulose-degrading microorganisms could decrease the risk of ARGs spreading and make compost products more security.},

 abstract = {Phenylarsonic feed additives were once widely used in poultry and swine production around the world, which brought significant and unnecessary health risk to consumers due to elevated residues of arsenic species in animal tissues. They also increased the risk to ecosystems via releases of inorganic arsenic through their environmental transformation. Out of concern for the negative impacts on human and ecosystem health, China, one of the world's largest poultry and swine producing countries, recently banned the use of phenylarsonic feed additives in food animal production. This ban, if fully enforced, will result in reduction of approximately 1160 cancer cases per year from the consumption of chicken meat alone, and avoid an annual economic loss of nearly 0.6 billion CNY according to our risk analysis. Furthermore, the inventory of anthropogenic arsenic emissions in China will be cut by approximately one-third with the phase-out of phenylarsonic feed additives. This ban is also expected to lead to significant reduction in the accumulation of arsenic in the soils of farmlands fertilized by poultry and swine wastes and, consequently, lower the accumulation of arsenic in food crops grown on them, which could have even greater public health benefits. But effective enforcement of the ban is crucial, and it will require detailed supervision of veterinary drug production and distribution, and enhanced surveillance of animal feeds and food products. Furthermore, control of other major anthropogenic sources of arsenic is also necessary to better protect human health and the environment.},

 abstract = {Widespread antibiotic use increases the risk of livestock acting as potential reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) that may be transferred to human and animal pathogens. Particularly, maternal-infant transmission of antibiotics via breastmilk represents a great concern regarding infant health. In this study, we investigated the effects of 4-week low-dose antibiotic (LDA) treatment on the host immunity and antibiotic resistomes in weaned piglets. Transcriptomic analyses of ileum tissues revealed that the affected genes were largely enriched in innate immunity-related pathways. Significantly reduced protein expression of inflammatory factors, i.e., IFN-\textgreek{g}, IL-6 were observed. In addition, analyses of antibiotic resistomes identified a total of 1,021 ARGs related to 39 classes of antibiotics. The samples exhibited highly individual-specific diversity and no significant difference in the structure and diversity of ARGs and mobile gene elements (MGE) after LDA exposure for both colon and ileum samples. Despite of that, there were significant changes in the abundance of two transferrable ARGs [Erm(T) and tcr3] related to the antibiotics administered, implying an increased risk of transferrable antibiotic resistance. There was a significant change in the abundance of one pathogenic species after LDA exposure in the colon samples and one in the ileum samples, but there were no significant differences in the matched ARGs. Collectively, our findings reveal considerable changes in intestinal immunity-related genes, but minimal effects on gut antibiotic resistomes (ARGs and MGEs) in weaned piglets after 4 weeks LDA exposure. Our study provides a foundation for evaluating the longer-term cumulative effects of LDA use, especially the effects of maternal-infant LDA transmission, on antibiotic resistance and risks to infant health.},

 abstract = {Microbial arsenic (As) methylation and volatilization are important processes controlling the As biogeochemical cycle in paddy soils. To further understand these processes, we isolated a novel bacterial strain, SM-1, from an As-contaminated paddy soil. SM-1 showed strong As methylation and volatilization abilities, converting almost all arsenite (10 \textgreek{m}M) to dimethylarsenate and trimethylarsenic oxide in the medium and trimethylarsine gas into the headspace within 24 h, with trimethylarsine accounting for nearly half of the total As. On the basis of the 16S rRNA sequence, strain SM-1 represents a new species in a new genus within the family Cytophagaceae. Strain SM-1 is abundant in the paddy soil and inoculation of SM-1 greatly enhanced As methylation and volatilization in the soil. An arsenite methyltransferase gene (ArarsM) was cloned from SM-1. When expressed in Escherichia coli, ArArsM conferred the As methylation and volatilization abilities to E. coli and increased its resistance to arsenite. The high As methylation and volatilization abilities of SM-1 are likely attributed to an efficient ArArsM enzyme coupled with low arsenite efflux. These results suggest that strain SM-1 plays an important role in As methylation and volatilization in the paddy soil and has a great potential for As bioremediation.},

 abstract = {Orthology assignment is ideally suited for functional inference. However, because predicting orthology is computationally intensive at large scale, and most pipelines are relatively inaccessible (e.g., new assignments only available through database updates), less precise homology-based functional transfer is still the default for (meta-)genome annotation. We, therefore, developed eggNOG-mapper, a tool for functional annotation of large sets of sequences based on fast orthology assignments using precomputed clusters and phylogenies from the eggNOG database. To validate our method, we benchmarked Gene Ontology (GO) predictions against two widely used homology-based approaches: BLAST and InterProScan. Orthology filters applied to BLAST results reduced the rate of false positive assignments by 11{\%}, and increased the ratio of experimentally validated terms recovered over all terms assigned per protein by 15{\%}. Compared with InterProScan, eggNOG-mapper achieved similar proteome coverage and precision while predicting, on average, 41 more terms per protein and increasing the rate of experimentally validated terms recovered over total term assignments per protein by 35{\%}. EggNOG-mapper predictions scored within the top-5 methods in the three GO categories using the CAFA2 NK-partial benchmark. Finally, we evaluated eggNOG-mapper for functional annotation of metagenomics data, yielding better performance than interProScan. eggNOG-mapper runs $\sim$15$\times$ faster than BLAST and at least 2.5$\times$ faster than InterProScan. The tool is available standalone and as an online service at http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de.},

Gene surveys suggest the existence of an enormous number of branches(2), but even an approximation of the full scale of the tree has remained elusive. Recent depictions of the tree of life have focused either on the nature of deep evolutionary relationships(3-5) or on the known, well-classified diversity of life with an emphasis on eukaryotes(6). These approaches overlook the dramatic change in our understanding of life's diversity resulting from genomic sampling of previously unexamined environments. New methods to generate genome sequences illuminate the identity of organisms and their metabolic capacities, placing them in community and ecosystem contexts(7,8). Here, we use new genomic data from over 1,000 uncultivated and little known organisms, together with published sequences, to infer a dramatically expanded version of the tree of life, with Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya included. The depiction is both a global overview and a snapshot of the diversity within each major lineage. The results reveal the dominance of bacterial diversification and underline the importance of organisms lacking isolated representatives, with substantial evolution concentrated in a major radiation of such organisms. This tree highlights major lineages currently underrepresented in biogeochemical models and identifies radiations that are probably important for future evolutionary analyses.},

In total, 239 datasets adhered to inclusion criteria.

More datasets were available for environmental compartments (139/157), including wildlife, water, soil, and air/dust. Quantitative data from exposure-relevant sites (6/35) and environmental compartments (11/139) were scarce. AMR bacteria were detected in the contamination sources (66/66) wastewater and manure, and molecular data supporting their transmission from wastewater to the environment (1/66) were found. The abundance of AMR bacteria at exposure-relevant sites suggests risk for human exposure. Of publications pertaining to both environmental and human isolates, however, only one compared isolates from samples that had a clear spatial and temporal relationship, and no direct evidence was found for transmission to humans through the environment. To what extent the environment, compared to the clinical and veterinary domains, contributes to human exposure needs to be quantified. AMR bacteria in the environment, including sites relevant for human exposure, originate from contamination sources. Intervention strategies targeted at these sources could therefore limit emission of AMR bacteria to the environment.},

 abstract = {Environmental surveillance of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance could contribute toward the protection of human, animal and ecosystem health. However, justification for the choice of markers and sampling sites that informs about different risk scenarios is often lacking. Here, we define five fundamentally different objectives for surveillance of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance in the environment. The first objective is (1) to address the risk of transmission of already antibiotic-resistant bacteria to humans via environmental routes. The second is (2) to address the risk for accelerating the evolution of antibiotic resistance in pathogens through pollution with selective agents and bacteria of human or animal origin. The third objective is (3) to address the risks antibiotics pose for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem health, including the effects on ecosystem functions and services. The two final objectives overlap with those of traditional clinical surveillance, namely, to identify (4) the population-level resistance prevalence and (5) population-level antibiotic use. The latter two environmental surveillance objectives have particular potential in countries where traditional clinical surveillance data and antibiotic consumption data are scarce or absent. For each objective, the levels of evidence provided by different phenotypic and genotypic microbial surveillance markers, as well as antibiotic residues, are discussed and evaluated on a conceptual level. Furthermore, sites where monitoring would be particularly informative are identified. The proposed framework could be one of the starting points for guiding environmental monitoring and surveillance of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance on various spatiotemporal scales, as well as for harmonizing such activities with existing human and animal surveillance systems.},

By mixing a large variety of bacteria and promoting their proximity, WWTPs constitute potential hotspots for the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Concerns have been expressed regarding the potential of WWTPs to spread antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from environmental reservoirs to human pathogens. We utilized epicPCR (Emulsion, Paired Isolation and Concatenation PCR) to detect the bacterial hosts of ARGs in two WWTPs. We identified the host distribution of four resistance-associated genes (tetM, int1, qacE\textgreek{D}1and blaOXA-58) in influent and effluent. The bacterial hosts of these resistance genes varied between the WWTP influent and effluent, with a generally decreasing host range in the effluent. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, it was determined that the resistance gene carrying bacteria include both abundant and rare taxa. Our results suggest that the studied WWTPs mostly succeed in decreasing the host range of the resistance genes during the treatment process. Still, there were instances where effluent contained resistance genes in bacterial groups not carrying these genes in the influent. By permitting exhaustive profiling of resistance-associated gene hosts in WWTP bacterial communities, the application of epicPCR provides a new level of precision to our resistance gene risk estimates.},

In sewer systems, human-associated and environmental bacteria are mixed together and exposed to many substances known to increase HGT, including various antibacterial compounds. In wastewaters, those substances are most often detected below concentrations known to induce HGT individually. Still, it is possible that such wastewaters induce HGT, for example via mixture effects. Here, a panel of antibiotics, biocides and other pharmaceuticals was measured in filter-sterilized municipal and hospital wastewater samples from Gothenburg, Sweden. The effects on HGT of the chemical mixtures in these samples were investigated by exposing a complex bacterial donor community together with a GFP-tagged E.~coli recipient strain. Recipients that captured sulfonamide resistance-conferring mobile genetic elements (MGEs) from the bacterial community were enumerated and characterized by replicon typing, antibiotic susceptibility testing and long read sequencing. While exposure to municipal wastewater did not result in any detectable change in HGT rates, exposure to hospital wastewater was associated with an increase in the proportion of recipients that acquired sulfonamide resistance but also a drastic decrease in the total number of recipients. Although, concentrations were generally higher in hospital than municipal wastewater, none of the measured substances could individually explain the observed effects of hospital wastewater. The great majority of the MGEs captured were IncN plasmids, and resistance to several antibiotics was co-transferred in most cases. Taken together, the data show no evidence that chemicals present in the studied municipal wastewater induce HGT. Still, the increased relative abundance of transconjugants after exposure to hospital wastewater could have implications for the risks of both emergence and transmission of resistant bacteria.},

To explore the roles of class 1 integrons in spreading antibiotic resistance genes in environmental compartments, the dynamics of integrons were followed in biofilm reactors treating synthetic wastewater respectively spiked with streptomycin (STM) and oxytetracycline (OTC). The relative abundance of the integron-integrase gene (intI1) increased 12 or 29-fold respectively when treated with STM or OTC, under incrementally increasing dosage regimes from 0 to 50~mg L-1. Significant increases in intI1 abundance initially occurred at an antibiotic dose of 0.1~mg L-1. At the beginning of the experiment, 51{\%} to 64{\%} of integrons carried no gene cassettes. In STM and OTC spiked systems, there was a significant increase in the proportion of integrons that contained resistance gene cassettes, particularly at intermediate and higher antibiotic concentrations. Gene cassettes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides, trimethoprim, beta-lactam, erythromycin, and quaternary ammonium compounds were all detected in the treated systems. Three tetracycline resistance genes (tetA, tetC, tetG) were significantly correlated with the abundance of intI1 (p~{\textless}~0.01), despite no tet resistance being present as a gene cassette. Genome sequencing of isolates showed synteny between the tet resistance genes and intI1, mediated through linkage to transposable elements including Tn3, IS26 and ISCR3. Class 1 integrons appeared to be under positive selection in the presence of antibiotics, and might have actively acquired new gene cassettes during the experiment.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Hypothetical proteins [HP] are those that are predicted to be expressed in an organism, but no evidence of their existence is known. In the recent past, annotation and curation efforts have helped overcome the challenge in understanding their diverse functions. Techniques to decipher sequence-structure-function relationship, especially in terms of functional modelling of the HPs have been developed by researchers, but using the features as classifiers for HPs has not been attempted. With the rise in number of annotation strategies, next-generation sequencing methods have provided further understanding the functions of HPs.

RESULTS

In our previous work, we developed a six-point classification scoring schema with annotation pertaining to protein family scores, orthology, protein interaction/association studies, bidirectional best BLAST hits, sorting signals, known databases and visualizers which were used to validate protein interactions. In this study, we introduced three more classifiers to our annotation system, viz. pseudogenes linked to HPs, homology modelling and non-coding RNAs associated to HPs. We discuss the challenges and performance of these classifiers using machine learning heuristics with an improved accuracy from Perceptron (81.08 to 97.67), Naive Bayes (54.05 to 96.67), Decision tree J48 (67.57 to 97.00), and SMO{\_}npolyk (59.46 to 96.67).

CONCLUSION

With the introduction of three new classification features, the performance of the nine-point classification scoring schema has an improved accuracy to functionally annotate the HPs.},

 abstract = {Most aerobic bacteria exist in dormant states within natural environments. In these states, they endure adverse environmental conditions such as nutrient starvation by decreasing metabolic expenditure and using alternative energy sources. In this study, we investigated the energy sources that support persistence of two aerobic thermophilic strains of the environmentally widespread but understudied phylum Chloroflexi. A transcriptome study revealed that Thermomicrobium roseum (class Chloroflexia) extensively remodels its respiratory chain upon entry into stationary phase due to nutrient limitation. Whereas primary dehydrogenases associated with heterotrophic respiration were downregulated, putative operons encoding enzymes involved in molecular hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur compound oxidation were significantly upregulated. Gas chromatography and microsensor experiments showed that T. roseum aerobically respires H2 and CO at a range of environmentally relevant concentrations to sub-atmospheric levels. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the hydrogenases and carbon monoxide dehydrogenases mediating these processes are widely distributed in Chloroflexi genomes and have probably been horizontally acquired on more than one occasion. Consistently, we confirmed that the sporulating isolate Thermogemmatispora sp. T81 (class Ktedonobacteria) also oxidises atmospheric H2 and CO during persistence, though further studies are required to determine if these findings extend to mesophilic strains. This study provides axenic culture evidence that atmospheric CO supports bacterial persistence and reports the third phylum, following Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria, to be experimentally shown to mediate the biogeochemically and ecologically important process of atmospheric H2 oxidation. This adds to the growing body of evidence that atmospheric trace gases are dependable energy sources for bacterial persistence.},

Batch adsorption of all four separately tested QACs to primary sludge reached equilibrium within 4h. At a nominal, initial QAC concentration of 300mg/L and a sludge volatile solids concentration of 1g/L, the extent of adsorption was 13, 88, 67, and 89{\%} for the C(12)TMA, C(16)TMA, C(12)BDMA, and C(16)BDMA, respectively, and correlated positively to the QAC hydrophobicity and negatively to their critical micelle concentration. Equilibrium partitioning data were described by the Freundlich isotherm model. The adsorption capacity of the four sludges was very similar. In binary QAC mixtures, QACs with relatively high adsorption affinity and at relatively high aqueous concentrations decreased the adsorption of QACs with a low adsorption affinity. At pH 7, about 40{\%} of the sludge-C(12)TMA desorbed, whereas less than 5{\%} of the sludge-C(16)BDMA desorbed in 10 days. The effect of pH was negligible on the desorption extent of C(12)TMA at a pH range 4-10 over 10 days, whereas increasing the solution pH to 10 resulted in more than 50{\%} desorption of C(16)BDMA. Given the fact that approximately 50{\%} of the municipal biosolids are land-applied in the US, the data of this study would help in the assessment of the fate of QACs and their potential effect on human and environmental health.},

Remarkably, the phylogenetic pattern of N responses is similar when merging data across locations. Thus, we can identify bacterial clades - the size of which are highly variable across the bacterial tree - that respond consistently to N addition across locations.

However, we lack a predictive understanding of how bacterial communities respond to such global changes. Here, we tested whether phylogenetic information might be more predictive of the response of bacterial taxa to some forms of global change than others. We analysed the composition of soil bacterial communities from perturbation experiments that simulated warming, drought, elevated CO2 concentration and phosphorus (P) addition. Bacterial responses were phylogenetically conserved to all perturbations. The phylogenetic depth of these responses varied minimally among the types of perturbations and was similar when merging data across locations, implying that the context of particular locations did not affect the phylogenetic pattern of response. We further identified taxonomic groups that responded consistently to each type of perturbation. These patterns revealed that, at the level of family and above, most groups responded consistently to only one or two types of perturbations, suggesting that traits with different patterns of phylogenetic conservation underlie the responses to different perturbations. We conclude that a phylogenetic approach may be useful in predicting how soil bacterial communities respond to a variety of global changes.

However, little is known so far about effects of wastewater, applied for decades, on the abundance of IncP-1 plasmids and class 1 integrons which may contribute to the accumulation and spread of resistance genes in the environment, and their correlation with heavy metal concentrations. Therefore, a chronosequence of soils that were irrigated with wastewater from 0 to 100 years was sampled in the Mezquital Valley in Mexico in the dry season. The total community DNA was extracted and the absolute and relative abundance (relative to 16S rRNA genes) of antibiotic resistance genes (tet(W), tet(Q), aadA), class 1 integrons (intI1), quaternary ammonium compound resistance genes (qacE+qacE\textgreek{D}1) and IncP-1 plasmids (korB) were quantified by real-time PCR. Except for intI1 and qacE+qacE\textgreek{D}1 the abundances of selected genes were below the detection limit in non-irrigated soil. Confirming the results of a previous study, the absolute abundance of 16S rRNA genes in the samples increased significantly over time (linear regression model, p {\textless} 0.05) suggesting an increase in bacterial biomass due to repeated irrigation with wastewater. Correspondingly, all tested antibiotic resistance genes as well as intI1 and korB significantly increased in abundance over the period of 100 years of irrigation. In parallel, concentrations of the heavy metals Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Cr significantly increased. However, no significant positive correlations were observed between the relative abundance of selected genes and years of irrigation, indicating no enrichment in the soil bacterial community due to repeated wastewater irrigation or due to a potential co-selection by increasing concentrations of heavy metals.},

Organophosphorus (OP) compounds are one major class of contaminant and can undergo microbial degradation, however, no studies have applied system-wide ecogenomic tools to investigate OP degradation or use metagenomics to understand the underlying mechanisms of biodegradation in situ and predict degradation potential. Thus, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the functional genes and genomic potential underpinning degradation and community responses to contamination. Here we address this knowledge gap by performing shotgun sequencing of community DNA from agricultural soils with a history of pesticide usage and profiling shifts in functional genes and microbial taxa abundance. Our results showed two distinct groups of soils defined by differing functional and taxonomic profiles. Degradation assays suggested that these groups corresponded to the organophosphorus degradation potential of soils, with the fastest degrading community being defined by increases in transport and nutrient cycling pathways and enzymes potentially involved in phosphorus metabolism. This was against a backdrop of taxonomic community shifts potentially related to contamination adaptation and reflecting the legacy of exposure. Overall our results highlight the value of using holistic system-wide metagenomic approaches as a tool to predict microbial degradation in the context of the ecology of contaminated habitats.},

With simple preparation, wide structural variety, and versatile incorporation into consumer products, there have been manifold developments and applications of these structures. Generally operating via disruption of one of the most fundamental structures in bacteria-the cell membrane-leading to cell lysis and bacterial death, the QACs were once thought to be impervious to resistance. Developments over the past decades, however, have shown this to be far from the truth. It is now known that a large family of bacterial genes (generally termed qac genes) encode efflux pumps capable of expelling many QAC structures from bacterial cells, leading to a decrease in susceptibility to QACs; methods of regulation of qac transcription are also understood. Importantly, qac genes can be horizontally transferred via plasmids to other bacteria and are often transmitted alongside other antibiotic-resistant genes; this dual threat represents a significant danger to human health. In this review, both QAC development and QAC resistance are documented, and possible strategies for addressing and overcoming QAC-resistant bacteria are discussed.},

 abstract = {In Listeria monocytogenes, it has been proposed that the VirSR two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) and two ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, VirAB and AnrAB, constitute a complex TCS/ABC transporter system which has been recognized as a unique resistance mode. The role of the putative VirAB-VirSR-AnrAB system in antimicrobial resistance and the respective contributions of the members of the system to resistance were investigated in this study. We constructed gene deletion mutants of L. monocytogenes EGD-e and complemented strains of the mutants and determined MICs of antimicrobial agents against these strains against using the agar dilution method. We assessed the relative expression levels of target genes by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and measured promoter activity levels by \textgreek{b}-galactosidase assays. Our results showed that the VirAB-VirSR-AnrAB system mediates not only nisin and bacitracin resistance but also resistance to cephalosporins, ethidium bromide (EtBr), and benzalkonium chloride (BC). In this system, two ABC transporters, VirAB and AnrAB, play distinct roles in cefotaxime resistance: the former is responsible only for antimicrobial sensing and signaling by VirSR, while the latter contributes to transportation of antimicrobials. Notably, VirAB itself, rather than the VirAB-VirSR-AnrAB system as a whole, contributes to kanamycin and tetracycline resistance. On the basis of the results obtained from this study, we speculate that VirAB acts as a sensor for VirSR in response to cephalosporins, bacitracin, nisin, EtBr, and BC, while VirAB itself plays a role in response to kanamycin and tetracycline in L. monocytogenes EGD-e.IMPORTANCE This report describes TCS/ABC transporter modules characterized in Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e.

 abstract = {Chlorine disinfection to drinking water plays an important role in preventing and controlling waterborne disease outbreaks globally. Nevertheless, little is known about why it enriches the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in bacteria after chlorination. Here, ARGs released from killed antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and culturable chlorine-injured bacteria produced in the chlorination process as the recipient, were investigated to determine their contribution to the horizontal transfer of ARGs during disinfection treatment. We discovered Escherichia coli, Salmonella aberdeen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis showed diverse resistance to sodium hypochlorite, and transferable RP4 could be released from killed sensitive donor consistently. Meanwhile, the survival of chlorine-tolerant injured bacteria with enhanced cell membrane permeabilisation and a strong oxidative stress-response demonstrated that a physiologically competent cell could be transferred by RP4 with an improved transformation frequency of up to 550 times compared with the corresponding untreated bacteria. Furthermore, the water quality factors involving chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), ammonium nitrogen and metal ions (Ca2+ and K+) could significantly promote above transformation frequency of released RP4 into injured E. faecalis. Our findings demonstrated that the chlorination process promoted the horizontal transfer of plasmids by natural transformation, which resulted in the exchange of ARGs across bacterial genera and the emergence of new ARB, as well as the transfer of chlorine-injured opportunistic pathogen from non-ARB to ARB. Considering that the transfer elements were quite resistant to degradation through disinfection, this situation poses a potential risk to public health.},

 abstract = {UNLABELLED

Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide health risk, but the influence of animal agriculture on the genetic context and enrichment of individual antibiotic resistance alleles remains unclear. Using quantitative PCR followed by amplicon sequencing, we quantified and sequenced 44 genes related to antibiotic resistance, mobile genetic elements, and bacterial phylogeny in microbiomes from U.S. laboratory swine and from swine farms from three Chinese regions. We identified highly abundant resistance clusters: groups of resistance and mobile genetic element alleles that cooccur. For example, the abundance of genes conferring resistance to six classes of antibiotics together with class 1 integrase and the abundance of IS6100-type transposons in three Chinese regions are directly correlated. These resistance cluster genes likely colocalize in microbial genomes in the farms. Resistance cluster alleles were dramatically enriched (up to 1 to 10{\%} as abundant as 16S rRNA) and indicate that multidrug-resistant bacteria are likely the norm rather than an exception in these communities. This enrichment largely occurred independently of phylogenetic composition; thus, resistance clusters are likely present in many bacterial taxa. Furthermore, resistance clusters contain resistance genes that confer resistance to antibiotics independently of their particular use on the farms. Selection for these clusters is likely due to the use of only a subset of the broad range of chemicals to which the clusters confer resistance. The scale of animal agriculture and its wastes, the enrichment and horizontal gene transfer potential of the clusters, and the vicinity of large human populations suggest that managing this resistance reservoir is important for minimizing human risk.

IMPORTANCE

Agricultural antibiotic use results in clusters of cooccurring resistance genes that together confer resistance to multiple antibiotics. The use of a single antibiotic could select for an entire suite of resistance genes if they are genetically linked. No links to bacterial membership were observed for these clusters of resistance genes. These findings urge deeper understanding of colocalization of resistance genes and mobile genetic elements in resistance islands and their distribution throughout antibiotic-exposed microbiomes. As governments seek to combat the rise in antibiotic resistance, a balance is sought between ensuring proper animal health and welfare and preserving medically important antibiotics for therapeutic use. Metagenomic and genomic monitoring will be critical to determine if resistance genes can be reduced in animal microbiomes, or if these gene clusters will continue to be coselected by antibiotics not deemed medically important for human health but used for growth promotion or by medically important antibiotics used therapeutically.},

 abstract = {Heritable hypermutation in bacteria is mainly due to alterations in the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system. MMR-deficient strains have been described from several bacterial species, and all of the strains exhibit increased mutation frequency and recombination, which are important mechanisms for acquired drug resistance in bacteria. Antibiotics select for drug-resistant strains and refine resistance determinants on plasmids, thus stimulating DNA recombination via the MMR system. Antibiotics can also act as indirect promoters of antibiotic resistance by inducing the SOS system and certain error-prone DNA polymerases. These alterations have clinical consequences in that efficacious treatment of bacterial infections requires high doses of antibiotics and/or a combination of different classes of antimicrobial agents. There are currently few new drugs with low endogenous resistance potential, and the development of such drugs merits further research.},

 abstract = {The spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria throughout the food chain constitutes a public health concern. To understand the contribution of fresh produce in shaping antibiotic resistance bacteria and integron prevalence in the food chain, 333 antibiotic resistance Gram negative isolates were collected from organic and conventionally produced fruits (pears, apples, and strawberries) and vegetables (lettuces, tomatoes, and carrots). Although low levels of resistance have been detected, the bacterial genera identified in the assessed fresh produce are often described not only as environmental, but mostly as commensals and opportunistic pathogens. The genomic characterization of integron-harboring isolates revealed a high number of mobile genetic elements and clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes, of which we highlight the presence of as mcr-1, qnrA1, bla GES-11, mphA, and oqxAB. The study of class 1 (n = 8), class 2 (n = 3) and class 3 (n = 1) integrons, harbored by species such as Morganella morganii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, led to the identification of different integron promoters (PcW, PcH1, PcS, and PcWTNG-10) and cassette arrays (containing drfA, aadA, cmlA, estX, sat, and bla GES). In fact, the diverse integron backbones were associated with transposable elements (e.g., Tn402, Tn7, ISCR1, Tn2 (*), IS26, IS1326, and IS3) that conferred greater mobility. This is also the first appearance of In1258, In1259, and In3-13, which should be monitored to prevent their establishment as successfully dispersed mobile resistance integrons. These results underscore the growing concern about the dissemination of acquired resistance genes by mobile elements in the food chain.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Microorganisms are not only indispensable to ecosystem functioning, they are also keystones for emerging technologies. In the last 15 years, the number of studies on environmental microbial communities has increased exponentially due to advances in sequencing technologies, but the large amount of data generated remains difficult to analyze and interpret. Recently, metabarcoding analysis has shifted from clustering reads using Operational Taxonomical Units (OTUs) to Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs). Differences between these methods can seriously affect the biological interpretation of metabarcoding data, especially in ecosystems with high microbial diversity, as the methods are benchmarked based on low diversity datasets.

RESULTS

In this work we have thoroughly examined the differences in community diversity, structure, and complexity between the OTU and ASV methods. We have examined culture-based mock and simulated datasets as well as soil- and plant-associated bacterial and fungal environmental communities. Four key findings were revealed. First, analysis of microbial datasets at family level guaranteed both consistency and adequate coverage when using either method. Second, the performance of both methods used are related to community diversity and sample sequencing depth. Third, differences in the method used affected sample diversity and number of detected differentially abundant families upon treatment; this may lead researchers to draw different biological conclusions. Fourth, the observed differences can mostly be attributed to low abundant (relative abundance {\textless} 0.1{\%}) families, thus extra care is recommended when studying rare species using metabarcoding. The ASV method used outperformed the adopted OTU method concerning community diversity, especially for fungus-related sequences, but only when the sequencing depth was sufficient to capture the community complexity.

CONCLUSIONS

Investigation of metabarcoding data should be done with care. Correct biological interpretation depends on several factors, including in-depth sequencing of the samples, choice of the most appropriate filtering strategy for the specific research goal, and use of family level for data clustering.},

 abstract = {Multidrug resistance (MDR) of pathogens is an ongoing public health crisis exacerbated by the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes via conjugative plasmids. Factors that stabilize these plasmids in bacterial communities contribute to an even higher incidence of MDR, given the increased likelihood that a host will already contain a plasmid when it acquires another through conjugation. Here, we show one such stabilizing factor is host-plasmid coevolution under antibiotic selection, which facilitated the emergence of MDR via two distinct plasmids in communities consisting of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae once antibiotics were removed. In our system, evolution promoted greater stability of a plasmid in its coevolved host. Further, pleiotropic effects resulted in greater plasmid persistence in both novel host-plasmid combinations and, in some cases, multi-plasmid hosts. This evolved stability favoured the generation of MDR cells and thwarted their loss within communities with multiple plasmids. By selecting for plasmid persistence, the application of antibiotics may promote MDR well after their original period of use.},

Ecological aspects of AMR evolution and the complexity of its molecular mechanisms are explained. Major concepts, such as intrinsic, acquired and adaptive resistance, as well as tolerance and heteroresistance, are also clarified. More importantly, the problematic of biofilms and their role in AMR, namely their main resistance and tolerance mechanisms, are elucidated. Finally, some of the most promising anti-biofilm strategies being investigated are reviewed. Much is still to be done regarding the study of AMR and the discovery of new anti-biofilm strategies.

 abstract = {Abstract

Conjugation enables the exchange of genetic elements throughout environments, including the human gut microbiome. Conjugative elements can carry and transfer clinically relevant metabolic pathways which makes precise identification of these systems in metagenomic samples clinically important. Here, we outline two distinct methods to identify conjugative systems in the human gut microbiome. We first show that conjugative systems exhibit strong population and age-level stratification. Additionally, we find that the total relative abundance of all conjugative systems present in a sample is not an informative metric to use, regardless of the method of identifying the systems. Finally, we demonstrate that the majority of assembled conjugative systems are not included within metagenomic bins, and that only a small proportion of the binned conjugative systems are included in ``high-quality'' metagenomic bins. Our findings highlight that conjugative systems differ between general North Americans and a cohort of North American pre-term infants, revealing a potential use as an age-related biomarker. Furthermore, conjugative systems can distinguish between other geographical-based cohorts. Our findings emphasize the need to identify and analyze conjugative systems outside of standard metagenomic binning pipelines.

Importance

The human gut microbiome is increasingly being associated with human health outcomes through shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The usual approach of metagenomic-level analyses is to bin assembled sequences into approximations of bacterial genomes and perform further investigations on the resultant bins. Here, we show that type IV conjugative systems differ between age and geographically-based cohorts and that these systems are systematically excluded by binning algorithms. We suggest that analysis of type IV conjugative systems should be added to the current metagenomic analysis approaches as they contain much information that could explain differences between cohorts beyond those we investigated.},

 abstract = {There is a rising concern that antibiotics, and possibly other antimicrobial agents, can promote horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. For most types of antimicrobials their ability to induce conjugation below minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) is still unknown. Our aim was therefore to explore the potential of commonly used antibiotics and antibacterial biocides to induce horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance. Effects of a wide range of sub-MIC concentrations of the antibiotics cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and the antibacterial biocides chlorhexidine digluconate, hexadecyltrimethylammoniumchloride and triclosan were investigated using a previously optimized culture-based assay with a complex bacterial community as a donor of mobile resistance elements and a traceable Escherichia coli strain as a recipient. Chlorhexidine (24.4\textgreek{m}g/L), triclosan (0.1mg/L), gentamicin (0.1mg/L) and sulfamethoxazole (1mg/L) significantly increased the frequencies of transfer of antibiotic resistance whereas similar effects were not observed for any other tested antimicrobial compounds. This corresponds to 200 times below the MIC of the recipient for chlorhexidine, 1/20 of the MIC for triclosan, 1/16 of the MIC for sulfamethoxazole and right below the MIC for gentamicin. To our best knowledge, this is the first study showing that triclosan and chlorhexidine could stimulate the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance. Together with recent research showing that tetracycline is a potent inducer of conjugation, our results indicate that several antimicrobials including both common antibiotics and antibacterial biocides at low concentrations could contribute to antibiotic resistance development by facilitating the spread of antibiotic resistance between bacteria.},

Acidobacteria possesses an inventory of genes involved in diverse metabolic pathways, as evidenced by their pan-genomic profiles.

Our results support antibiotic resistance as a core function in the human gut microbiome, with tetracycline-resistant ribosomal protection proteins and Class A beta-lactamases being the most widely distributed resistance mechanisms worldwide. ShortBRED markers are applicable to other homology-based search tasks, which we demonstrate here by identifying phylogenetic signatures of antibiotic resistance across more than 3,000 microbial isolate genomes.

The genome of B510 consisted of a single chromosome (3,311,395 bp) and six plasmids, designated as pAB510a (1,455,109 bp), pAB510b (723,779 bp), pAB510c (681,723 bp), pAB510d (628,837 bp), pAB510e (537,299 bp), and pAB510f (261,596 bp). The chromosome bears 2893 potential protein-encoding genes, two sets of rRNA gene clusters (rrns), and 45 tRNA genes representing 37 tRNA species. The genomes of the six plasmids contained a total of 3416 protein-encoding genes, seven sets of rrns, and 34 tRNAs representing 19 tRNA species. Eight genes for plasmid-specific tRNA species are located on either pAB510a or pAB510d.

Here we analyze relative resistance gene abundance and accompanying extent of fecal pollution in publicly available metagenomic data, using crAssphage sequences as a marker of human fecal contamination (crAssphage is a bacteriophage that is exceptionally abundant in, and specific to, human feces). We find that the presence of resistance genes can largely be explained by fecal pollution, with no clear signs of selection in the environment, with the exception of environments polluted by very high levels of antibiotics from manufacturing, where selection is evident. Our results demonstrate the necessity to take into account fecal pollution levels to avoid making erroneous assumptions regarding environmental selection of antibiotic resistance.},

 abstract = {Small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes, 16S in bacteria and 18S in eukaryotes, have been the standard phylogenetic markers used to characterize microbial diversity and evolution for decades. However, the reference databases of full-length SSU rRNA gene sequences are skewed to well-studied ecosystems and subject to primer bias and chimerism, which results in an incomplete view of the diversity present in a sample. We combine poly(A)-tailing and reverse transcription of SSU rRNA molecules with synthetic long-read sequencing to generate high-quality, full-length SSU rRNA sequences, without primer bias, at high throughput. We apply our approach to samples from seven different ecosystems and obtain more than a million SSU rRNA sequences from all domains of life, with an estimated raw error rate of 0.17{\%}. We observe a large proportion of novel diversity, including several deeply branching phylum-level lineages putatively related to the Asgard Archaea. Our approach will enable expansion of the SSU rRNA reference databases by orders of magnitude, and contribute to a comprehensive census of the tree of life.},

In the early years of natural product discovery from microorganisms (The Golden Age), new antibiotics were found with relative ease from low-throughput fermentation and whole cell screening methods. Later, molecular genetic and medicinal chemistry approaches were applied to modify and improve the activities of important chemical scaffolds, and more sophisticated screening methods were directed at target disease states. In the 1990s, the pharmaceutical industry moved to high-throughput screening of synthetic chemical libraries against many potential therapeutic targets, including new targets identified from the human genome sequencing project, largely to the exclusion of natural products, and discovery rates dropped dramatically. Nonetheless, natural products continued to provide key scaffolds for drug development. In the current millennium, it was discovered from genome sequencing that microbes with large genomes have the capacity to produce about ten times as many secondary metabolites as was previously recognized. Indeed, the most gifted actinomycetes have the capacity to produce around 30-50 secondary metabolites. With the precipitous drop in cost for genome sequencing, it is now feasible to sequence thousands of actinomycete genomes to identify the {\textquotedbl}biosynthetic dark matter{\textquotedbl} as sources for the discovery of new and novel secondary metabolites.

 abstract = {The abundance of different SSU rRNA ({\textquotedbl}16S{\textquotedbl}) gene sequences in environmental samples is widely used in studies of microbial ecology as a measure of microbial community structure and diversity. However, the genomic copy number of the 16S gene varies greatly - from one in many species to up to 15 in some bacteria and to hundreds in some microbial eukaryotes. As a result of this variation the relative abundance of 16S genes in environmental samples can be attributed both to variation in the relative abundance of different organisms, and to variation in genomic 16S copy number among those organisms. Despite this fact, many studies assume that the abundance of 16S gene sequences is a surrogate measure of the relative abundance of the organisms containing those sequences. Here we present a method that uses data on sequences and genomic copy number of 16S genes along with phylogenetic placement and ancestral state estimation to estimate organismal abundances from environmental DNA sequence data. We use theory and simulations to demonstrate that 16S genomic copy number can be accurately estimated from the short reads typically obtained from high-throughput environmental sequencing of the 16S gene, and that organismal abundances in microbial communities are more strongly correlated with estimated abundances obtained from our method than with gene abundances. We re-analyze several published empirical data sets and demonstrate that the use of gene abundance versus estimated organismal abundance can lead to different inferences about community diversity and structure and the identity of the dominant taxa in microbial communities. Our approach will allow microbial ecologists to make more accurate inferences about microbial diversity and abundance based on 16S sequence data.},

To counteract the spread of AR, it is paramount to know which organisms harbor mobile AR genes and which organisms engage in HGT. Despite methods that characterize the overall abundance of AR genes in the gut, technological limitations of short-read sequencing have precluded linking bacterial taxa to specific mobile genetic elements (MGEs) encoding AR genes. Here, we apply Hi-C, a high-throughput, culture-independent method, to surveil the bacterial carriage of MGEs. We compare two healthy individuals with seven neutropenic patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, who receive multiple courses of antibiotics, and are acutely vulnerable to the threat of multidrug-resistant infections. We find distinct networks of HGT across individuals, though AR and mobile genes are associated with more diverse taxa within the neutropenic patients than the healthy subjects. Our data further suggest that HGT occurs frequently over a several-week period in both cohorts. Whereas most efforts to understand the spread of AR genes have focused on pathogenic species, our findings shed light on the role of the human gut microbiome in this process.},

The existing scientific literature contains conflicting results, from no observable effect of glyphosate to the enrichment of agricultural pathogens such as Fusarium spp. We conducted a comprehensive field-based study to compare the microbial communities on the roots of plants that received a foliar application of glyphosate to adjacent plants that did not. The 2-year study was conducted in Beltsville, MD, and Stoneville, MS, with corn and soybean crops grown in a variety of organic and conventional farming systems. By sequencing environmental metabarcode amplicons, the prokaryotic and fungal communities were described, along with chemical and physical properties of the soil. Sections of corn and soybean roots were plated to screen for the presence of plant pathogens. Geography, farming system, and season were significant factors determining the composition of fungal and prokaryotic communities. Plots treated with glyphosate did not differ from untreated plots in overall microbial community composition after controlling for other factors. We did not detect an effect of glyphosate treatment on the relative abundance of organisms such as Fusarium spp.IMPORTANCE Increasing the efficiency of food production systems while reducing negative environmental effects remains a key societal challenge to successfully meet the needs of a growing global population. The herbicide glyphosate has become a nearly ubiquitous component of agricultural production across the globe, enabling an increasing adoption of no-till agriculture. Despite this widespread use, there remains considerable debate on the consequences of glyphosate exposure. In this paper, we examine the effect of glyphosate on soil microbial communities associated with the roots of glyphosate-resistant crops. Using metabarcoding techniques, we evaluated prokaryotic and fungal communities from agricultural soil samples (n = 768). No effects of glyphosate were found on soil microbial communities associated with glyphosate-resistant corn and soybean varieties across diverse farming systems.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

An approach utilizing the long-read capability of the Oxford Nanopore MinION to rapidly sequence bacterial ribosomal operons of complex natural communities was developed. Microbial fingerprinting employs domain-specific forward primers (16S rRNA subunit), reverse primers (23S rRNA subunit), and a high-fidelity Taq polymerase with proofreading capabilities. Amplicons contained both ribosomal subunits for broad-based phylogenetic assignment ({\~{}} 3900~bp of sequence), plus the intergenic spacer (ITS) region ({\~{}} 300~bp) for potential strain-specific identification.

RESULTS

To test the approach, bacterial rRNA operons ({\~{}} 4200~bp) were amplified from six DNA samples employing a mixture of farm soil and bioreactor DNA in known concentrations. Each DNA sample mixture was barcoded, sequenced in quadruplicate (n~=~24), on two separate 6-h runs using the MinION system (R7.3 flow cell; MAP005 and 006 chemistry). From nearly 90,000 MinION reads, roughly 33,000 forward and reverse sequences were obtained. This yielded over 10,000 2D sequences which were analyzed using a simplified data analysis pipeline based on NCBI Blast and assembly with Geneious software. The method could detect over 1000 operational taxonomic units in the sample sets in a quantitative manner. Global sequence coverage for the various rRNA operons ranged from 1 to 1951x. An iterative assembly scheme was developed to reconstruct those rRNA operons with {\textgreater} 35x coverage from a set of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, and Gemmatimonadetes. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes from each operon demonstrated similar tree topologies with species/strain-level resolution.

CONCLUSIONS

This sequencing method represents a cost-effective way to profile microbial communities. Because the MinION is small, portable, and runs on a laptop, the possibility of microbiota characterization in the field or on robotic platforms becomes realistic.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Viruses are central to microbial community structure in all environments. The ability to generate large metagenomic assemblies of mixed microbial and viral sequences provides the opportunity to tease apart complex microbiome dynamics, but these analyses are currently limited by the tools available for analyses of viral genomes and assessing their metabolic impacts on microbiomes.

DESIGN

Here we present VIBRANT, the first method to utilize a hybrid machine learning and protein similarity approach that is not reliant on sequence features for automated recovery and annotation of viruses, determination of genome quality and completeness, and characterization of viral community function from metagenomic assemblies. VIBRANT uses neural networks of protein signatures and a newly developed v-score metric that circumvents traditional boundaries to maximize identification of lytic viral genomes and integrated proviruses, including highly diverse viruses. VIBRANT highlights viral auxiliary metabolic genes and metabolic pathways, thereby serving as a user-friendly platform for evaluating viral community function. VIBRANT was trained and validated on reference virus datasets as well as microbiome and virome data.

RESULTS

VIBRANT showed superior performance in recovering higher quality viruses and concurrently reduced the false identification of non-viral genome fragments in comparison to other virus identification programs, specifically VirSorter, VirFinder, and MARVEL. When applied to 120,834 metagenome-derived viral sequences representing several human and natural environments, VIBRANT recovered an average of 94{\%} of the viruses, whereas VirFinder, VirSorter, and MARVEL achieved less powerful performance, averaging 48{\%}, 87{\%}, and 71{\%}, respectively. Similarly, VIBRANT identified more total viral sequence and proteins when applied to real metagenomes. When compared to PHASTER, Prophage Hunter, and VirSorter for the ability to extract integrated provirus regions from host scaffolds, VIBRANT performed comparably and even identified proviruses that the other programs did not. To demonstrate applications of VIBRANT, we studied viromes associated with Crohn's disease to show that specific viral groups, namely Enterobacteriales-like viruses, as well as putative dysbiosis associated viral proteins are more abundant compared to healthy individuals, providing a possible viral link to maintenance of diseased states.

CONCLUSIONS

The ability to accurately recover viruses and explore viral impacts on microbial community metabolism will greatly advance our understanding of microbiomes, host-microbe interactions, and ecosystem dynamics. Video Abstract.},

 abstract = {The past decades have been a golden era during which great tasks were accomplished in the field of microbiology, including food microbiology. In the past, culture-dependent methods have been the primary choice to investigate bacterial diversity. However, using cultureindependent high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes has greatly facilitated studies exploring the microbial compositions and dynamics associated with health and diseases. These culture-independent DNA-based studies generate large-scale data sets that describe the microbial composition of a certain niche. Consequently, understanding microbial diversity becomes of greater importance when investigating the composition, function, and dynamics of the microbiota associated with health and diseases. Even though there is no general agreement on which diversity index is the best to use, diversity indices have been used to compare the diversity among samples and between treatments with controls. Tools such as the Shannon- Weaver index and Simpson index can be used to describe population diversity in samples. The purpose of this review is to explain the principles of diversity indices, such as Shannon- Weaver and Simpson, to aid general microbiologists in better understanding bacterial communities. In this review, important questions concerning microbial diversity are addressed. Information from this review should facilitate evidence-based strategies to explore microbial communities.},

@article{Kim.2018,
 abstract = {While the misuse of antibiotics has clearly contributed to the emergence and proliferation of resistant bacterial pathogens, with major health consequences, it remains less clear if the widespread use of disinfectants, such as benzalkonium chlorides (BAC), a different class of biocides than antibiotics, has contributed to this problem. Here, we provide evidence that exposure to BAC coselects for antibiotic-resistant bacteria and describe the underlying genetic mechanisms. After inoculation with river sediment, BAC-fed bioreactors selected for several bacterial taxa, including the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that were more resistant to several antibiotics than their counterparts in a control (no BAC) bioreactor. A metagenomic analysis of the bioreactor microbial communities, confirmed by gene cloning experiments with the derived isolates, suggested that integrative and conjugative elements encoding a BAC efflux pump together with antibiotic resistance genes were responsible for these results. Furthermore, the exposure of the P. aeruginosa isolates to increasing concentrations of BAC selected for mutations in pmrB (polymyxin resistance) and physiological adaptations that contributed to a higher tolerance to polymyxin B and other antibiotics. The physiological adaptations included the overexpression of mexCD-oprJ multidrug efflux pump genes when BAC was added in the growth medium at subinhibitory concentrations. Collectively, our results demonstrated that disinfectants promote antibiotic resistance via several mechanisms and highlight the need to remediate (degrade) disinfectants in nontarget environments to further restrain the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.IMPORTANCE Benzalkonium chlorides (BAC) are biocides broadly used in disinfectant solutions. Disinfectants are widely used in food processing lines, domestic households, and pharmaceutical products and are typically designed to have a different mode of action than antibiotics to avoid interfering with the use of the latter. Whether exposure to BAC makes bacteria more resistant to antibiotics remains an unresolved issue of obvious practical consequences for public health. Using an integrated approach that combines metagenomics of natural microbial communities with gene cloning experiments with isolates and experimental evolution assays, we show that the widely used benzalkonium chloride disinfectants promote clinically relevant antibiotic resistance. Therefore, more attention should be given to the usage of these disinfectants, and their fate in nontarget environments should be monitored more tightly.},

 abstract = {Tracking antibiotic consumption patterns over time and across countries could inform policies to optimize antibiotic prescribing and minimize antibiotic resistance, such as setting and enforcing per capita consumption targets or aiding investments in alternatives to antibiotics. In this study, we analyzed the trends and drivers of antibiotic consumption from 2000 to 2015 in 76 countries and projected total global antibiotic consumption through 2030. Between 2000 and 2015, antibiotic consumption, expressed in defined daily doses (DDD), increased 65{\%} (21.1-34.8 billion DDDs), and the antibiotic consumption rate increased 39{\%} (11.3-15.7 DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants per day). The increase was driven by low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where rising consumption was correlated with gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC) growth (P = 0.004). In high-income countries (HICs), although overall consumption increased modestly, DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants per day fell 4{\%}, and there was no correlation with GDPPC. Of particular concern was the rapid increase in the use of last-resort compounds, both in HICs and LMICs, such as glycylcyclines, oxazolidinones, carbapenems, and polymyxins. Projections of global antibiotic consumption in 2030, assuming no policy changes, were up to 200{\%} higher than the 42 billion DDDs estimated in 2015. Although antibiotic consumption rates in most LMICs remain lower than in HICs despite higher bacterial disease burden, consumption in LMICs is rapidly converging to rates similar to HICs. Reducing global consumption is critical for reducing the threat of antibiotic resistance, but reduction efforts must balance access limitations in LMICs and take account of local and global resistance patterns.},

The accuracy of these analyses depends strongly on the choice of primers. The overall coverage and phylum spectrum of 175 primers and 512 primer pairs were evaluated in silico with respect to the SILVA 16S/18S rDNA non-redundant reference dataset (SSURef 108 NR). Based on this evaluation a selection of 'best available' primer pairs for Bacteria and Archaea for three amplicon size classes (100-400, 400-1000, $\geq$ 1000 bp) is provided. The most promising bacterial primer pair (S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17/S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21), with an amplicon size of 464 bp, was experimentally evaluated by comparing the taxonomic distribution of the 16S rDNA amplicons with 16S rDNA fragments from directly sequenced metagenomes. The results of this study may be used as a guideline for selecting primer pairs with the best overall coverage and phylum spectrum for specific applications, therefore reducing the bias in PCR-based microbial diversity studies.},

In single-species experiments selection for antibiotic resistance occurs at very low antibiotic concentrations. However, it is unclear how far these findings can be extrapolated to natural environments, where species are embedded within complex communities. We competed isogenic strains of Escherichia coli, differing exclusively in a single chromosomal resistance determinant, in the presence and absence of a pig faecal microbial community across a gradient of antibiotic concentration for two relevant antibiotics: gentamicin and kanamycin. We show that the minimal selective concentration was increased by more than one order of magnitude for both antibiotics when embedded in the community. We identified two general mechanisms were responsible for the increase in minimal selective concentration: an increase in the cost of resistance and a protective effect of the community for the susceptible phenotype. These findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution and selection of antibiotic resistance, and can inform future risk assessment efforts on antibiotic concentrations.},

 abstract = {Mass production and use of antibiotics and antimicrobials in medicine and agriculture have existed for over 60 years, and has substantially benefited public health and agricultural productivity throughout the world. However, there is growing evidence that resistance to antibiotics (AR) is increasing both in benign and pathogenic bacteria, posing an emerging threat to public and environmental health in the future. Although evidence has existed for years from clinical data of increasing AR, almost no quantitative environmental data exist that span increased industrial antibiotic production in the 1950s to the present; i.e., data that might delineate trends in AR potentially valuable for epidemiological studies. To address this critical knowledge gap, we speculated that AR levels might be apparent in historic soil archives as evidenced by antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) abundances over time. Accordingly, DNA was extracted from five long-term soil-series from different locations in The Netherlands that spanned 1940 to 2008, and 16S rRNA gene and 18 ARG abundances from different major antibiotic classes were quantified. Results show that ARG from all classes of antibiotics tested have significantly increased since 1940, but especially within the tetracyclines, with some individual ARG being {\textgreater}15 times more abundant now than in the 1970s. This is noteworthy because waste management procedures have broadly improved and stricter rules on nontherapeutic antibiotic use in agriculture are being promulgated. Although these data are local to The Netherlands, they suggest basal environmental levels of ARG still might be increasing, which has implications to similar locations around the world.},

Here, we analyse how changes due to COVID-19 in terms of antimicrobial usage, infection prevention, and health systems affect the emergence, transmission, and burden of AMR. Increased hand hygiene, decreased international travel, and decreased elective hospital procedures may reduce AMR pathogen selection and spread in the short term. However, the opposite effects may be seen if antibiotics are more widely used as standard healthcare pathways break down. Over 6 months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the dynamics of AMR remain uncertain.

 abstract = {The integron/gene cassette systems identified in bacteria comprise a class of genetic elements that allow adaptation by acquisition of gene cassettes. Integron gene cassettes have been shown to facilitate the spread of drug resistance in human pathogens but their role outside a clinical setting has not been explored extensively. We sequenced 2145 integron gene cassettes from four marine sediment samples taken from the vicinity of Halifax Nova Scotia, Canada, increasing the number of gene cassettes obtained from environmental microbial communities by 10-fold. Sequence analyses reveals that the majority of these cassettes encode novel proteins and that this study is consistent with previous claims of high cassette diversity as we estimate a Chao1 diversity index of approximately 3000 cassettes from these samples. The functional distribution of environmental cassettes recovered in this study, when compared with that of cassettes from the only other source with significant sampling (Vibrio genomes) suggests that alternate selection regimes might be acting on these two gene pools. The majority of cassettes recovered in this study encode novel, unknown proteins. In instances where we obtained multiple alleles of a novel protein we demonstrate that non-synonymous versus synonymous substitution rates ratios suggest relaxed selection. Cassette-encoded proteins with known homologues represent a variety of functions and prevalent among these are isochorismatases; proteins involved in iron scavenging. Phylogenetic analysis of these isochorismatases as well as of cassette-encoded acetyltransferases reveals a patchy distribution, suggesting multiple sources for the origin of these cassettes. Finally, the two most environmentally similar sample sites considered in this study display the greatest overlap of cassette types, consistent with the hypothesis that cassette genes encode adaptive proteins.},

In this study we analyzed whether these azithromycin-mediated effects require interaction with the ribosome. We blocked the access of azithromycin to the ribosome in P. aeruginosa PAO1 by expressing the 23S rRNA methylase ErmBP from Clostridium perfringens. Ribosome protection prevented the azithromycin-mediated reduction of elastase and rhamnolipid production, as well as the inhibition of swarming motility. Ribosome protection also prevented the killing of stationary-phase cells, suggesting that the cell-killing effect of azithromycin does not result solely from membrane destabilization. We further show that rhamnolipids are involved in cell killing, probably by increasing the uptake of the hydrophobic azithromycin molecule. These results have important implications for the treatment with azithromycin of patients chronically colonized by P. aeruginosa and might explain the variability in the efficacy of azithromycin treatments.},

Clarithromycin utilizes autophagy in order to form NETs, and these NETs are decorated with antimicrobial peptide LL-37. Clarithromycin-induced NETs are able to inhibit Acinetobacter baumannii growth and biofilm formation in an LL-37-dependent manner. Additionally, LL-37 antimicrobial function depends on NET scaffold integrity.

Here, we test this using multispecies bacterial soil communities comprising species varying in their proficiency to host a large conjugative mercury resistance plasmid, pQBR103. The plasmid reached higher community-level abundance where beneficial and when introduced to the community in a more proficient host species. Proficient plasmid host species were also better able to disseminate the plasmid to a wider diversity of host species. These findings suggest that the dynamics of plasmids in natural bacterial communities depend not only upon the plasmid's attributes and the selective environment but also upon the proficiency of their host species.},

For terrestrial animal production, potential sources consist of feed, humans, water, air/dust, soil, wildlife, rodents, arthropods and equipment. Among those, evidence was found for introduction with feed and humans, for the other sources, the importance could not be assessed. Several ARB of highest priority for public health, such as carbapenem or extended-spectrum cephalosporin and/or fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacterales (including Salmonella enterica), fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter spp., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis were identified. Among highest priority ARGs blaCTX-M, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaOXA-48-like, blaOXA-23, mcr, armA, vanA, cfr and optrA were reported. These highest priority bacteria and genes were identified in different sources, at primary and post-harvest level, particularly faeces/manure, soil and water. For all sectors, reducing the occurrence of faecal microbial contamination of fertilisers, water, feed and the production environment and minimising persistence/recycling of ARB within animal production facilities is a priority. Proper implementation of good hygiene practices, biosecurity and food safety management systems is very important. Potential AMR-specific interventions are in the early stages of development. Many data gaps relating to sources and relevance of transmission routes, diversity of ARB and ARGs, effectiveness of mitigation measures were identified.

It generates high-resolution contact profiles for selected genomic sites based on limited amounts of sequencing reads. 4C-seq can be used to study multiple aspects of genome organization. It primarily serves to identify specific long-range DNA contacts between individual regulatory DNA modules, forming for example regulatory chromatin loops between enhancers and promoters, or architectural chromatin loops between cohesin- and CTCF- associated domain boundaries. Additionally, 4C-seq contact profiles can reveal the contours of contact domains and can identify the structural domains that co-occupy the same nuclear compartment. Here, we present an improved step-by-step protocol for sample preparation and the generation of 4C-seq sequencing libraries, including an optimized PCR and 4C template purification strategy. In addition, a data processing pipeline is provided which processes multiplexed 4C-seq reads directly from FASTQ files and generates files compatible with standard genome browsers for visualization and further statistical analysis of the data such as peak calling using peakC. The protocols and the pipeline presented should readily allow anyone to generate, visualize and interpret their own high resolution 4C contact datasets.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

A number of human diseases such as obesity and diabetes are associated with changes or imbalances in the gut microbiota (GM). Laboratory mice are commonly used as experimental models for such disorders. The introduction and dynamic development of next generation sequencing techniques have enabled detailed mapping of the GM of both humans and animal models. Nevertheless there is still a significant knowledge gap regarding the human and mouse common GM core and thus the applicability of the latter as an animal model. The aim of the present study was to identify inter- and intra-individual differences and similarities between the GM composition of particular mouse strains and humans.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS

A total of 1509428 high quality tag-encoded partial 16S rRNA gene sequences determined using 454/FLX Titanium (Roche) pyro-sequencing reflecting the GM composition of 32 human samples from 16 individuals and 88 mouse samples from three laboratory mouse strains commonly used in diabetes research were analyzed using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA), nonparametric multivariate analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and alpha diversity measures. A reliable cutoff threshold for low abundant taxa estimated on the basis of the present study is recommended for similar trials.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE

Distinctive quantitative differences in the relative abundance of most taxonomic groups between the examined categories were found. All investigated mouse strains clustered separately, but with a range of shared features when compared to the human GM. However, both mouse fecal, caecal and human fecal samples shared to a large extent not only representatives of the same phyla, but also a substantial fraction of common genera, where the number of shared genera increased with sequencing depth. In conclusion, the GM of mice and humans is quantitatively different (in terms of abundance of specific phyla and species) but share a large qualitatively similar core.},

There is increasing concern about the growing resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the environment, and their ecotoxic effects. Increasingly, antibiotic resistance is seen as an ecological problem. This includes both the ecology of resistance genes and that of the resistant bacteria themselves. Little is known about the effects of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics and disinfectants on environmental bacteria, especially with respect to resistance. According to the present state of our knowledge, the impact on the frequency of resistance transfer by antibacterials present in the environment is questionable. The input of resistant bacteria into the environment seems to be an important source of resistance in the environment. The possible impact of resistant bacteria on the environment is not yet known.

Biocides, such as herbicides, are routinely tested for toxicity but not for sublethal effects on microbes. Many biocides are known to induce an adaptive multiple-antibiotic resistance phenotype. This can be due to either an increase in the expression of efflux pumps, a reduced synthesis of outer membrane porins, or both. Exposures of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to commercial formulations of three herbicides-dicamba (Kamba), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and glyphosate (Roundup)-were found to induce a changed response to antibiotics. Killing curves in the presence and absence of sublethal herbicide concentrations showed that the directions and the magnitudes of responses varied by herbicide, antibiotic, and species. When induced, MICs of antibiotics of five different classes changed up to 6-fold. In some cases the MIC increased, and in others it decreased. Herbicide concentrations needed to invoke the maximal response were above current food maximum residue levels but within application levels for all herbicides. Compounds that could cause induction had additive effects in combination. The role of soxS, an inducer of the AcrAB efflux pump, was tested in \textgreek{b}-galactosidase assays with soxS-lacZ fusion strains of E. coli. Dicamba was a moderate inducer of the sox regulon. Growth assays with Phe-Arg \textgreek{b}-naphtylamide (PA\textgreek{b}N), an efflux pump inhibitor, confirmed a significant role of efflux in the increased tolerance of E. coli to chloramphenicol in the presence of dicamba and to kanamycin in the presence of glyphosate. Pathways of exposure with relevance to the health of humans, domestic animals, and critical insects are discussed.

IMPORTANCE

Increasingly common chemicals used in agriculture, domestic gardens, and public places can induce a multiple-antibiotic resistance phenotype in potential pathogens. The effect occurs upon simultaneous exposure to antibiotics and is faster than the lethal effect of antibiotics. The magnitude of the induced response may undermine antibiotic therapy and substantially increase the probability of spontaneous mutation to higher levels of resistance. The combination of high use of both herbicides and antibiotics in proximity to farm animals and important insects, such as honeybees, might also compromise their therapeutic effects and drive greater use of antibiotics. To address the crisis of antibiotic resistance requires broadening our view of environmental contributors to the evolution of resistance.},

Necrotic enteritis in chickens is caused by C. perfringens strains that produce the pore-forming toxin NetB, the major virulence factor for this disease. Like many other C. perfringens toxins and antibiotic resistance genes, NetB is encoded on a conjugative plasmid. Conjugative transfer of the netB-containing plasmid pJIR3535 has been demonstrated in vitro with a netB-null mutant. This study has investigated the effect of plasmid transfer on disease pathogenesis, with two genetically distinct transconjugants constructed under in vitro conditions, within the intestinal tract of chickens. This study also demonstrates that plasmid transfer can occur naturally in the host gut environment without the need for antibiotic selective pressure to be applied. The demonstration of plasmid transfer within the chicken host may have implications for the progression and pathogenesis of C. perfringens-mediated disease. Such horizontal gene transfer events are likely to be common in the clostridia and may be a key factor in strain evolution, both within animals and in the wider environment.IMPORTANCEClostridium perfringens is a major gastrointestinal pathogen of poultry. C. perfringens strains that express the NetB pore-forming toxin, which is encoded on a conjugative plasmid, cause necrotic enteritis. This study demonstrated that the conjugative transfer of the netB-containing plasmid to two different nonpathogenic strains converted them into disease-causing strains with disease-causing capability similar to that of the donor strain. Plasmid transfer of netB and antibiotic resistance was also demonstrated to occur within the gastrointestinal tract of chickens, with approximately 14{\%} of the isolates recovered comprising three distinct, in vivo-derived, transconjugant types. The demonstration of in vivo plasmid transfer indicates the potential importance of strain plasticity and the contribution of plasmids to strain virulence.},

 abstract = {Resistance integrons are bacterial genetic platforms that can capture and express antibiotic resistance genes embedded within gene cassettes. The capture and shuffling of gene cassettes are mediated by the integrase IntI, the expression of which is regulated by the SOS response in Escherichia coli. Gene cassettes are expressed from a common Pc promoter. Despite the clinical and environmental relevance of integrons, the selective forces responsible for their evolution and maintenance are poorly understood. Here, we conducted pairwise competition experiments in order to assess the fitness cost of class 1 integrons in E. coli. We found that integrons are low-cost structures and that their cost is further reduced by their tight regulation. We show that the SOS response prevents the expression of costly integrases whose cost is activity dependent. Thus, when an integron is repressed, its cost depends mostly on the expression of its gene cassettes array and increases with Pc strength and the number of cassettes in the array. Furthermore, different cassettes have different costs. Lastly, we showed that subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations promoted the selection of integron-carrying bacteria, especially those with a strong Pc promoter. These results provide new insights into the evolutionary dynamics of integron-carrying bacterial populations.},

Alignment methods have high specificity but are limited in their ability to detect sequences that are divergent from the reference database, which can result in a substantial false negative rate. We address this shortcoming through the creation of Meta-MARC, which enables detection of diverse resistance sequences using hierarchical, DNA-based Hidden Markov Models. We first describe Meta-MARC and then demonstrate its efficacy on simulated and functional metagenomic datasets. Meta-MARC has higher sensitivity relative to competing methods.

The recent improvements in rapid and affordable next generation sequencing technologies along with sophisticated bioinformatics platforms has the potential to revolutionize diagnostic microbiology and microbial surveillance. Through the study and characterization of ARGs in bacterial genomes and complex metagenomes, we are now able to reveal the genetic scope of AR in single bacteria and complex communities, and obtain important insights into AR dynamics at species, population and community levels, providing novel epidemiological and ecological perspectives. A suite of bioinformatics pipelines and ARG databases are currently available for genomic and metagenomic data analyses. However, different platforms may significantly vary and therefore, it is crucial to choose the tools that are most suitable for the specific analysis being conducted. This review provides a detailed account of available bioinformatics platforms for identification and characterization of ARGs and associated genetic elements within single bacterial isolates and complex environmental samples. It focuses primarily on currently available ARG databases, employing a comprehensive benchmarking pipeline to identify ARGs in four bacterial genomes (Aeromonas salmonicida, Bacillus cereus, Burkholderia sp. and Escherichia coli) and three shotgun metagenomes (human gut, poultry litter and soil) providing insight into which databases should be used for different analytical scenarios.},

In this study, fresh vegetables (lettuce, spinach and cucumber), and cropland soil were screened by qPCR for ten ARGs (blaTEM, blaCTX-M-1 group, blaCTX-M-9 group, blaOXA-48, blaVIM, mecA, sul1, qnrA, qnrS and armA) in their viral DNA fraction. The presence of ARGs in the phage DNA was analyzed before and after propagation experiments in an Escherichia coli host strain to evaluate the ability of the phage particles to infect a host. ARGs were found in the phage DNA fraction of all matrices, although with heterogeneous values. ARG prevalence was significantly higher in lettuce and soil, and the most common overall were \textgreek{b}-lactamases. After propagation experiments, an increase in ARG densities in phage particles was observed in samples of all four matrices, confirming that part of the isolated phage particles were infectious. This study reveals the abundance of free, replicative ARG-containing phage particles in vegetable matrices and cropland soil.

RESULTS

Kalign now uses a SIMD accelerated version of the bit-parallel Gene Myers algorithm to estimate pariwise distances, adopts a sequence embedding strategy and the bi-secting K-means algorithm to rapidly construct guide trees for thousands of sequences. The new version maintains high alignment accuracy on both protein and nucleotide alignments and scales better than other MSA tools.

Pre-treatment of sewage sludge prior to land application offers the potential to abate enteric microorganisms that carry genes conferring resistance to antibiotics. Pre-treatment practices that accomplish this should have the desirable effect of reducing the risk of contamination of crops or adjacent water with antibiotic resistance genes carried in these materials. In the present study, we obtained municipal sludge that had been subjected to one of five treatments. There were, anaerobic-digestion or aerobic-digestion, in both instances with and without dewatering; and heat-treatment and pelletization. Each of the five types of biosolids was applied to an agricultural field at commercial rates, following which lettuce, carrots and radishes were planted. Based on qPCR, the estimated antibiotic gene loading rates were comparable with each of the five biosolids. However, the gene abundance in soil following application of the pelletized biosolids was anomalously lower than expected. Following application, the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes decreased in a generally coherent fashion, except sul1 which increased in abundance during the growing season in the soil fertilized with pelletized biosolids. Based on qPCR and high throughput sequencing evidence for transfer of antibiotic resistance genes from the biosolids to the vegetables at harvest was weak. Clostridia were more abundant in soils receiving any of the biosolids except the pelletized. Overall, the behavior of antibiotic resistance genes in soils receiving aerobically or anaerobically-digested biosolids was consistent and coherent with previous studies. However, dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes in soils receiving the heat treated pelletized biosolids were very different, and the underlying mechanisms merit investigation.},

 abstract = {Antibiotic resistance has emerged globally as one of the biggest threats to human and animal health. Although the excessive use of antibiotics is recognized as accelerating the selection for resistance, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that natural environments are {\textquotedbl}hot spots{\textquotedbl} for the development of both ancient and contemporary resistance mechanisms. Given that pharmaceuticals can be entrained onto agricultural land through anthropogenic activities, this could be a potential driver for the emergence and dissemination of resistance in soil bacteria. Using functional metagenomics, we interrogated the {\textquotedbl}resistome{\textquotedbl} of bacterial communities found in a collection of Canadian agricultural soil, some of which had been receiving antibiotics widely used in human medicine (macrolides) or food animal production (sulfamethazine, chlortetracycline, and tylosin) for up to 16 years. Of the 34 new antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) recovered, the majority were predicted to encode (multi)drug efflux systems, while a few share little to no homology with established resistance determinants. We characterized several novel gene products, including putative enzymes that can confer high-level resistance against aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, and broad range of beta-lactams, with respect to their resistance mechanisms and clinical significance. By coupling high-resolution proteomics analysis with functional metagenomics, we discovered an unusual peptide, PPPAZI 4, encoded within an alternative open reading frame not predicted by bioinformatics tools. Expression of the proline-rich PPPAZI 4 can promote resistance against different macrolides but not other ribosome-targeting antibiotics, implicating a new macrolide-specific resistance mechanism that could be fundamentally linked to the evolutionary design of this peptide.IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance is a clinical phenomenon with an evolutionary link to the microbial pangenome. Genes and protogenes encoding specialized and potential resistance mechanisms are abundant in natural environments, but understanding of their identity and genomic context remains limited. Our discovery of several previously unknown antibiotic resistance genes from uncultured soil microorganisms indicates that soil is a significant reservoir of resistance determinants, which, once acquired and {\textquotedbl}repurposed{\textquotedbl} by pathogenic bacteria, can have serious impacts on therapeutic outcomes. This study provides valuable insights into the diversity and identity of resistance within the soil microbiome. The finding of a novel peptide-mediated resistance mechanism involving an unpredicted gene product also highlights the usefulness of integrating proteomics analysis into metagenomics-driven gene discovery.},

Antibiotic residues are entrained into agricultural soil through the application of animal and human wastes, and irrigation with reclaimed water. The impact of a mixture of three macrolide antibiotics on the abundance of selected genes associated with antibiotic resistance and genetic mobility were determined in a long-term field experiment undertaken in London, Canada. Replicated plots received annual applications of a mixture of erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin every spring since 2010. Each antibiotic was added directly to the soil at a concentration of either 0.1 or 10~mg~kg~soil-1 and all plots were cropped to soybeans. By means of qPCR, no gene targets were enriched in soil exposed to the 0.1~mg~kg~soil-1 dose compared to untreated control. In contrast, the relative abundance of several gene targets including int1, sul2 and mphE increased significantly with the annual exposure to the 10~mg~kg~soil-1 dose. By means of high-throughput qPCR, numerous gene targets associated with resistance to aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, streptomycin, quaternary ammonium chemicals as well as mobile genetic elements (tnpA, IS26 and IS6100) were detected in soil exposed to 10~mg~kg~soil-1, but not the lower dose.

Next Generation Sequencing is the current method of choice to characterize microbial community composition. The taxonomic profile of a microbial community can be obtained either by shotgun analysis of random DNA fragments or through 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) amplicon sequencing. It has been previously shown that the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing approach yields quantitatively and qualitatively different results compared to shotgun metagenomics when the two techniques are used to assess microbial community composition on the same samples. However, most of such comparisons were either based on the recovery of 16S rDNA sequences in the shotgun metagenomics data or limited to a single microbiome or synthetic samples. Direct comparison of shotgun metagenomics and 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing on the same samples was performed only once in the recent literature, suggesting that the two methods yield comparable results. Here, we set out to compare the outcome of these two alternative approaches to the microbiome characterization in human gut microbiomes from stool samples. To this end, we processed six different samples with both techniques. We report here that shotgun next generation sequencing metagenomics allows much deeper characterization of the microbiome complexity, allowing identification of a larger number of species for each sample, compared to 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Further comparative studies in independent samples are called for.},

The device has a low capital cost, is by far the most portable DNA sequencer available, and can produce data in real-time. It has numerous prospective applications including improving genome sequence assemblies and resolution of repeat-rich regions. Before such a technology is widely adopted, it is important to assess its performance and limitations in respect of throughput and accuracy. In this study we assessed the performance of the MinION by re-sequencing three bacterial genomes, with very different nucleotide compositions ranging from 28.6{\%} to 70.7{\%}; the high G~+~C strain was underrepresented in the sequencing reads. We estimate the error rate of the MinION (after base calling) to be 38.2{\%}. Mean and median read lengths were 2~kb and 1~kb respectively, while the longest single read was 98~kb. The whole length of a 5~kb rRNA operon was covered by a single read. As the first nanopore-based single molecule sequencer available to researchers, the MinION is an exciting prospect; however, the current error rate limits its ability to compete with existing sequencing technologies, though we do show that MinION sequence reads can enhance contiguity of de novo assembly when used in conjunction with Illumina MiSeq data.},

 abstract = {Motivation

Metagenomic sequencing has become a crucial tool for obtaining a gene catalogue of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in a microbial community. A typical metagenomic sequencing produces a large amount of data (often in the order of terabytes or more), and computational tools are indispensable for efficient processing. In particular, error correction in metagenomics is crucial for accurate and robust genetic cataloging of microbial communities. However, many existing error-correction tools take a prohibitively long time and often bottleneck the whole analysis pipeline.

Results

To overcome this computational hurdle, we analyzed and exploited the data-level parallelism that exists in the error-correction procedure and proposed a tool named MUGAN that exploits both multi-core central processing units (CPUs) and multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) for co-processing. According to the experimental results, our approach reduced not only the time demand for denoising amplicons from approximately 59 hours to only 46 minutes, but also the overestimation of the number of OTUs, estimating 6.7 times less species-level OTUs than the baseline. In addition, our approach provides web-based intuitive visualization of results. Given its efficiency and convenience, we anticipate that our approach would greatly facilitate denoising efforts in metagenomics studies.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The impact of human activities on the environmental resistome has been documented in many studies, but there remains the controversial question of whether the increased antibiotic resistance observed in anthropogenically impacted environments is just a result of contamination by resistant fecal microbes or is mediated by indigenous environmental organisms. Here, to determine exactly how anthropogenic influences shape the environmental resistome, we resolved the microbiome, resistome, and mobilome of the planktonic microbial communities along a single river, the Han, which spans a gradient of human activities.

RESULTS

The bloom of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) was evident in the downstream regions and distinct successional dynamics of the river resistome occurred across the spatial continuum. We identified a number of widespread ARG sequences shared between the river, human gut, and pathogenic bacteria. These human-related ARGs were largely associated with mobile genetic elements rather than particular gut taxa and mainly responsible for anthropogenically driven bloom of the downstream river resistome. Furthermore, both sequence- and phenotype-based analyses revealed environmental relatives of clinically important proteobacteria as major carriers of these ARGs.

CONCLUSIONS

Our results demonstrate a more nuanced view of the impact of anthropogenic activities on the river resistome: fecal contamination is present and allows the transmission of ARGs to the environmental resistome, but these mobile genes rather than resistant fecal bacteria proliferate in environmental relatives of their original hosts.

 abstract = {Municipal water recycling processes are potential human and environmental exposure routes for low concentrations of persistent antibiotics. While the implications of such exposure scenarios are unknown, concerns have been raised regarding the possibility that continuous discharge of antibiotics to the environment may facilitate the development or proliferation of resistant strains of bacteria. As potable and non-potable water recycling schemes are continuously developed, it is imperative to improve our understanding of the fate of antibiotics during conventional and advanced wastewater treatment processes leading to high-quality water reclamation. This review collates existing knowledge with the aim of providing new insight to the influence of a wide range of treatment processes to the ultimate fate of antibiotics during conventional and advanced wastewater treatment. Although conventional biological wastewater treatment processes are effective for the removal of some antibiotics, many have been reported to occur at 10-1000 ng L(-1) concentrations in secondary treated effluents. These include beta-lactams, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines. Tertiary and advanced treatment processes may be required to fully manage environmental and human exposure to these contaminants in water recycling schemes. The effectiveness of a range of processes including tertiary media filtration, ozonation, chlorination, UV irradiation, activated carbon adsorption, and NF/RO filtration has been reviewed and, where possible, semi-quantitative estimations of antibiotics removals have been provided.},

We evaluate whether the current environmental risk assessment regulatory guidance is protective of antibiotic impacts on the environment, protective of antimicrobial resistance, and propose science-based protection goals for antibiotic manufacturing discharges. A review and meta-analysis was conducted of aquatic ecotoxicity data for antibiotics and for minimum selective concentration data derived from clinically relevant bacteria. Relative species sensitivity was investigated applying general linear models, and predicted no effect concentrations were generated for toxicity to aquatic organisms and compared with predicted no effect concentrations for resistance development. Prokaryotes were most sensitive to antibiotics but the range of sensitivities spanned up to several orders of magnitude. We show reliance on one species of (cyano)bacteria and the 'activated sludge respiration inhibition test' is not sufficient to set protection levels for the environment. Individually, neither traditional aquatic predicted no effect concentrations nor predicted no effect concentrations suggested to safeguard for antimicrobial resistance, protect against environmental or human health effects (via antimicrobial resistance development). Including data from clinically relevant bacteria and also more species of environmentally relevant bacteria in the regulatory framework would help in defining safe discharge concentrations for antibiotics for patient use and manufacturing that would protect environmental and human health. It would also support ending unnecessary testing on metazoan species.},

Environmental risk assessment (ERA) seeks to establish protection limits to minimise chemical impacts on the environment, but recent evidence suggests that the current regulatory approaches for ERA for antibiotics may not be adequate for protecting bacteria that have fundamental roles in ecosystem function. In this study we assess the differences in interspecies sensitivity of eight species of cyanobacteria to seven antibiotics (cefazolin, cefotaxime, ampicillin, sufamethazine, sulfadiazine, azithromycin and erythromycin) with three different modes of action. We found that variability in the sensitivity to these antibiotics between species was dependent on the mode of action and varied by up to 70 times for \textgreek{b}-lactams. Probabilistic analysis using species sensitivity distributions suggest that the current predicted no effect concentration PNEC for the antibiotics may be either over or under protective of cyanobacteria dependent on the species on which it is based and the mode of action of the antibiotic; the PNECs derived for the macrolide antibiotics were over protective but PNECs for \textgreek{b}-lactams were generally under protective. For some geographical locations we identify a significant risk to cyanobacteria populations based upon measured environmental concentrations of selected antibiotics. We conclude that protection limits, as determined according to current regulatory guidance, may not always be protective and might be better derived using SSDs and that including toxicity data for a wider range of (cyano-) bacteria would improve confidence for the ERA of antibiotics.},

This program can efficiently cluster a huge protein database with millions of sequences. However, the applications of the underlying algorithm are not limited to only protein sequences clustering, here we present several new programs using the same algorithm including cd-hit-2d, cd-hit-est and cd-hit-est-2d. Cd-hit-2d compares two protein datasets and reports similar matches between them; cd-hit-est clusters a DNA/RNA sequence database and cd-hit-est-2d compares two nucleotide datasets. All these programs can handle huge datasets with millions of sequences and can be hundreds of times faster than methods based on the popular sequence comparison and database search tools, such as BLAST.},

Through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), they can provide their host microorganisms with important functions such as antibiotic resistance and heavy metal resistance. In this study, six metagenomic libraries were constructed with plasmid DNA extracted from influent, activated sludge (AS) and digested sludge (DS) of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Compared with the metagenomes of the total DNA extracted from the same sectors of the wastewater treatment plant, the plasmid metagenomes had significantly higher annotation rates, indicating that the functional genes on plasmids are commonly shared by those studied microorganisms. Meanwhile, the plasmid metagenomes also encoded many more genes related to defense mechanisms, including ARGs. Searching against an antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) database and a metal resistance genes (MRGs) database revealed a broad-spectrum of antibiotic (323 out of a total 618 subtypes) and MRGs (23 out of a total 23 types) on these plasmid metagenomes. The influent plasmid metagenomes contained many more resistance genes (both ARGs and MRGs) than the AS and the DS metagenomes. Sixteen novel plasmids with a complete circular structure that carried these resistance genes were assembled from the plasmid metagenomes. The results of this study demonstrated that the plasmids in WWTPs could be important reservoirs for resistance genes, and may play a significant role in the horizontal transfer of these genes.},

The trend of the total ARG abundances in environments matched well with the levels of anthropogenic impacts on these environments. From the less impacted environments to the seriously impacted environments, the total ARG abundances increased up to three orders of magnitude, that is, from 3.2 $\times$ 10(-3) to 3.1 $\times$ 10(0) copy of ARG per copy of 16S-rRNA gene. The abundant ARGs were associated with aminoglycoside, bacitracin, \textgreek{b}-lactam, chloramphenicol, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, quinolone, sulphonamide and tetracycline, in agreement with the antibiotics extensively used in human medicine or veterinary medicine/promoters. The widespread occurrences and abundance variation trend of vancomycin resistance genes in different environments might imply the spread of vancomycin resistance genes because of the selective pressure resulting from vancomycin use. The simultaneous enrichment of 12 ARG types in adult chicken faeces suggests the coselection of multiple ARGs in this production system. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that samples belonging to the same environment generally possessed similar ARG compositions. Based on the co-occurrence pattern revealed by network analysis, tetM and aminoglycoside resistance protein, the hubs of the ARG network, are proposed to be indicators to quantitatively estimate the abundance of 23 other co-occurring ARG subtypes by power functions.},

Given the lack of comprehensive understanding of the ARG and MRG coselection, in this study both abundance relationship and genetic linkage between ARGs and MRGs were rigorously investigated by performing a genomic analysis of a large complete genome collection. Many more ARGs were enriched in human-associated bacteria compared with those subjected to less anthropogenic interference. The signatures of ARG and MRG co-occurrence were much more frequent and the distance linkages between ARGs and MRGs were much more intimate in human pathogens than those less human-associated bacteria. Moreover, the co-occurrence structures in the habitat divisions were significantly different, which could be attributed to their distinct gene transfer potentials. More exogenous ARGs and MRGs on the genomes of human pathogens indicated the importance of recent resistance acquisition in resistome development of human commensal flora. Overall, the study emphasizes the potential risk associated with ARG and MRG coselection of both environmental and medical relevance.},

 abstract = {The current epidemic of antibiotic resistance has been facilitated by the wide and rapid horizontal dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in microbial communities. Indeed, ARGs are often located on plasmids, which can efficiently shuttle genes across diverse taxa. While the existence conditions of plasmids have been extensively studied in a few model bacterial populations, their fate in complex bacterial communities is poorly understood. Here, we coupled plasmid transfer assays with serial growth experiments to investigate the persistence of the broad-host-range IncP-1 plasmid pKJK5 in microbial communities derived from a sewage treatment plant. The cultivation conditions combined different nutrient and oxygen levels, and were non-selective and non-conducive for liquid-phase conjugal transfer. Following initial transfer, the plasmid persisted in almost all conditions during a 10-day serial growth experiment (equivalent to 60 generations), with a transient transconjugant incidence up to 30{\%}. By combining cell enumeration and sorting with amplicon sequencing, we mapped plasmid fitness effects across taxa of the microbial community. Unexpected plasmid fitness benefits were observed in multiple phylotypes of Aeromonas, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas, which resulted in community-level plasmid persistence. We demonstrate, for the first time, that plasmid fitness effects across community members can be estimated in high-throughput without prior isolation. By gaining a fitness benefit when carrying plasmids, members within complex microbial communities might have a hitherto unrecognised potential to maintain plasmids for long-term community-wide access.},

Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) revealed that the strain employing sgRNA R6 exhibited 97{\%} and 84{\%} decreases in the transcriptional levels of the dfrB2 cassette and sul1, two typical ARGs, respectively. RT-qPCR analysis also demonstrated that the strain recruiting sgRNA R3 showed a 96{\%} decrease in the transcriptional level of intI1, and a conjugation assay revealed a 1,000-fold decrease in HGT rates of ARGs.

Currently, a limited number of prokaryotic MTs have been experimentally identified, which necessitates the expansion of bacterial MT diversity. In this study, we conducted a metagenomics-guided analysis for the discovery of potential bacterial MT genes from the soil microbiome. More specifically, we combined resistance gene enrichment through diversity loss, metagenomic mining with a dedicated MT database, evolutionary trace analysis, DNA chemical synthesis, and functional genomic validation to identify novel MTs. Results showed that Cu stress induced a compositional change in the soil microbiome, with an enrichment of metal-resistant bacteria in soils with higher Cu concentrations. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to obtain the gene pool of environmental DNA (eDNA), which was subjected to a local BLAST search against an MT database for detecting putative MT genes. Evolutional trace analysis led to the identification of 27 potential MTs with conserved cysteine/histidine motifs different from those of known prokaryotic MTs. Following chemical synthesis of these 27 potential MT genes and heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, six of them were found to improve the hosts' growth substantially and enhanced the hosts' sorption of Cu, Cd, and Zn, among which MT5 led to a 13.7-fold increase in Cd accumulation. Furthermore, four of them restored Cu and/or Cd resistance in two metal-sensitive E. coli strains.IMPORTANCE The metagenomics-guided procedure developed here bypasses the difficulties encountered in classic PCR-based approaches and led to the discovery of novel MT genes, which may be useful in developing bioremediation tools.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The spread of antibiotic resistance has become one of the most urgent threats to global health, which is estimated to cause 700,000 deaths each year globally. Its surrogates, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), are highly transmittable between food, water, animal, and human to mitigate the efficacy of antibiotics. Accurately identifying ARGs is thus an indispensable step to understanding the ecology, and transmission of ARGs between environmental and human-associated reservoirs. Unfortunately, the previous computational methods for identifying ARGs are mostly based on sequence alignment, which cannot identify novel ARGs, and their applications are limited by currently incomplete knowledge about ARGs.

RESULTS

Here, we propose an end-to-end Hierarchical Multi-task Deep learning framework for ARG annotation (HMD-ARG). Taking raw sequence encoding as input, HMD-ARG can identify, without querying against existing sequence databases, multiple ARG properties simultaneously, including if the input protein sequence is an ARG, and if so, what antibiotic family it is resistant to, what resistant mechanism the ARG takes, and if the ARG is an intrinsic one or acquired one. In addition, if the predicted antibiotic family is beta-lactamase, HMD-ARG further predicts the subclass of beta-lactamase that the ARG is resistant to. Comprehensive experiments, including cross-fold validation, third-party dataset validation in human gut microbiota, wet-experimental functional validation, and structural investigation of predicted conserved sites, demonstrate not only the superior performance of our method over the state-of-art methods, but also the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

CONCLUSIONS

We propose a hierarchical multi-task method, HMD-ARG, which is based on deep learning and can provide detailed annotations of ARGs from three important aspects: resistant antibiotic class, resistant mechanism, and gene mobility. We believe that HMD-ARG can serve as a powerful tool to identify antibiotic resistance genes and, therefore mitigate their global threat.

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of amplified methanotroph-specific 16S rDNA gene fragments revealed a more diverse type I (RuMP pathway) methanotrophic community than type II (serine pathway) in 17 soil samples taken along a 50 m transect. The type II methanotrophic community was less diverse, with the dominance of Methylocystis in almost all samples, and clustering with high similarity (85{\%}-88{\%}). Also, the results showed that the C/N ratio of soil organic matter could significantly affect the methanotrophic community structures. The DGGE results were supported by sequence analysis of cloned pmoA. Members of the genera Methylobacter (type I), Methylocaldum (type X), and Methylocystis (type II) appeared to be the dominant methanotrophs. From methanotrophic enrichments, we isolated type I Methylobacter sp., and 3 type II Methylocystis spp.,which appeared to be one of the dominant bacteria species in the soil sample from which isolates were obtained.},

In this article we define the notion of {\textquotedbl}sampling fraction{\textquotedbl} and demonstrate a major hurdle in performing DA analysis of microbiome data is the bias introduced by differences in the sampling fractions across samples. We introduce a methodology called Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction (ANCOM-BC), which estimates the unknown sampling fractions and corrects the bias induced by their differences among samples. The absolute abundance data are modeled using a linear regression framework. This formulation makes a fundamental advancement in the field because, unlike the existing methods, it (a) provides statistically valid test with appropriate p-values, (b) provides confidence intervals for differential abundance of each taxon, (c) controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR), (d) maintains adequate power, and (e) is computationally simple to implement.},

Increasingly, researchers are discovering associations between microbiome and a wide range of human diseases such as obesity, inflammatory bowel diseases, HIV, and so on. The first step towards microbiome wide association studies is the characterization of the composition of human microbiome under different conditions. Determination of differentially abundant microbes between two or more environments, known as differential abundance (DA) analysis, is a challenging and an important problem that has received considerable interest during the past decade. It is well documented in the literature that the observed microbiome data (OTU/SV table) are relative abundances with an excess of zeros. Since relative abundances sum to a constant, these data are necessarily compositional. In this article we review some recent methods for DA analysis and describe their strengths and weaknesses.},

In this study, a multiplex PCR assay for the detection of Clostridium botulinum types A, B, E, and F in food and fecal material was developed. The method employs four new primer pairs with equal melting temperatures, each being specific to botulinum neurotoxin gene type A, B, E, or F, and enables a simultaneous detection of the four serotypes. A total of 43 C. botulinum strains and 18 strains of other bacterial species were tested. DNA amplification fragments of 782 bp for C. botulinum type A alone, 205 bp for type B alone, 389 bp for type E alone, and 543 bp for type F alone were obtained. Other bacterial species, including C. sporogenes and the nontoxigenic nonproteolytic C. botulinum-like organisms, did not yield a PCR product. Sensitivity of the PCR for types A, E, and F was 10(2) cells and for type B was 10 cells per reaction mixture. With a two-step enrichment, the detection limit in food and fecal samples varied from 10(-2) spore/g for types A, B, and F to 10(-1) spore/g of sample material for type E. Of 72 natural food samples investigated, two were shown to contain C. botulinum type A, two contained type B, and one contained type E. The assay is sensitive and specific and provides a marked improvement in the PCR diagnostics of C. botulinum.},

The resistome, the plasmidome, and the bacterial community composition of samples from influents and treated effluents from a wastewater treatment plant located in Northern Portugal were studied using metagenomic techniques. Wastewater treatment contributed to reduce the abundance of resistance genes and of plasmid replicons, coinciding with a decline in the number of intrinsic resistance genes from Enterobacteriaceae, as well as with a reduction in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria after treatment. These taxons comprise bacterial pathogens, including those belonging to the ESKAPE group, which encompasses bacteria with the highest risk of acquiring antibiotic resistance, being the most relevant hosts of resistance genes acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Our results support that wastewater treatment efficiently removes the hosts of antibiotic resistance genes and, consequently, the harboured antibiotic resistance genes. Principal component analysis indicates that the resistome and the bacterial composition clustered together in influent samples, while did not cluster in final effluent samples. Our results suggest that wastewater treatment mitigates the environmental dissemination of urban resistome, through the removal of the hosts harbouring mobile resistance genes.},

The various combinations, organizations and expressions of virulence factors (VFs) are responsible for the diverse clinical symptoms of pathogen infections. Currently, whole-genome sequencing is widely used to decode potential novel or variant pathogens both in emergent outbreaks and in routine clinical practice. However, the efficient characterization of pathogenomic compositions remains a challenge for microbiologists or physicians with limited bioinformatics skills. Therefore, we introduced to VFDB an integrated and automatic pipeline, VFanalyzer, to systematically identify known/potential VFs in complete/draft bacterial genomes. VFanalyzer first constructs orthologous groups within the query genome and preanalyzed reference genomes from VFDB to avoid potential false positives due to paralogs. Then, it conducts iterative and exhaustive sequence similarity searches among the hierarchical prebuilt datasets of VFDB to accurately identify potential untypical/strain-specific VFs. Finally, via a context-based data refinement process for VFs encoded by gene clusters, VFanalyzer can achieve relatively high specificity and sensitivity without manual curation. In addition, a thoroughly optimized interactive web interface is introduced to present VFanalyzer reports in comparative pathogenomic style for easy online analysis.},

First, with the aid of text mining and manual curation, it now recorded the details of 1032 ICEs, including 270 with experimental supports and 762 from bioinformatics prediction. Second, as increasing evidence has shown that ICEs frequently mobilize the so-called 'hitchhikers', such as integrative and mobilizable elements (IMEs) and cis-mobilizable elements (CIMEs), 83 known transfer interactions between 49 IMEs and 7 CIMEs with 19 ICEs taken from the literature were included and illustrated with visually intuitive directed graphs. An expanded collection of 260 chromosome-borne IMEs and 235 CIMEs was also added. At last, ICEberg 2.0 provides an online tool ICEfinder to predict ICEs or IMEs in bacterial genome sequences. It combines a similarity search for the integrase, relaxase and/or type IV secretion system and the co-localization of these corresponding homologous genes. With the recent updates, ICEberg 2.0 might provide better support for understanding the biological traits of ICEs, especially as their interaction with cognate mobilizable elements may further promote horizontal gene flow.},

The concentrations of azithromycin, clarithromycin, methamphetamine and ecstasy in wastewater samples varied widely, ranging from non-detects to 300 ng L(-1). Among the macrolide antibiotics analyzed, azithromycin was consistently detected in influent and effluent samples. In general, influent samples contained relatively higher concentrations of the analytes than the effluents. Based on the daily flow rates and an average concentration of 17.5 ng L(-1) in the effluent, the estimated discharge of azithromycin was 200 mg day(-1) (range 63-400 mg day(-1)). Removal efficiency of the detected analytes from this WWTP were in the following order: urobilin{\textgreater}methamphetamine{\textgreater}azithromycin with percentages of removal of 99.9{\%}, 54.5{\%} and 47{\%}, respectively, indicating that the azithromycin and methamphetamine are relatively more recalcitrant than others and have potential for entering receiving waters.},

While LRA methods are scale-invariant, count compositional data are not; consequently, the conclusions we draw from LRA of lattice compositions depend on the scale of counts involved. We know that additive variation affects the relative abundance of small counts more than large counts; here we show that additive (quantization) variation comes from the discrete nature of count data itself, as well as (biological) variation in the system under study and (technical) variation from measurement and analysis processes. Variation due to quantization is inevitable, but its impact on conclusions depends on the underlying scale and distribution of counts. We illustrate the different distributions of real molecular bioscience data from different experimental settings to show why it is vital to understand the distributional characteristics of count data before applying and drawing conclusions from compositional data analysis methods.},

In this respect, class 1 integrons which are part of mobile genetic elements can confer several phenotypes including resistance to a broad range of antibiotic classes, heavy metals and biocides. They are linked to common resistance genes and have penetrated pathogenic and commensal bacteria likewise. Therefore its relative prevalence can be a proxy for antimicrobial resistance and anthropogenic pollution. Household environments are areas with a high influx of bacteria from humans, animals and foods, and biocides and detergents are frequently used. In this study we aimed to investigate the relative prevalence of class 1 integrons in household environments, in relation to the number of antibiotic and benzalkonium chloride resistant phenotypes of a sample point, for the validation of the relative prevalence of class 1 integrons as a screening tool for multi-resistance. Kitchen sink and bathroom sink U-bends, dishwasher, washing machines and toothbrushes of 28 households were probed. Copies /mL of class 1 integron integrase gene and 16SrDNA gene were determined by qPCR and bacteria of the respective sample were isolated on ampicillin selective agar plates, followed by the determination of the species and phenotypic resistance profiles. The relative prevalence of class 1 integrons in relation to 16SrDNA was calculated and correlated to phenotypic resistance. Our findings show a high relative prevalence of class 1 integrons in water reticulation systems of household environments and in particular shower U-bends. Furthermore, prevalence of class 1 integrons correlates strongly (rs = 0.95) with total phenotypic resistance at a sample point and suggest that a standardized assay determining the relative prevalence of class 1 integrons could be used as a useful screening tool in the assessment of multi-resistance in environmental samples.},

The discharge of treated effluent from WWTPs is a major pathway for the introduction of micropollutants to surface water. WWTPs act as primary barriers against the spread of micropollutants. WWTP removal efficiency of the selected micropollutants in 14 countries/regions depicts compound-specific variation in removal, ranging from 12.5 to 100{\%}. Advanced treatment processes, such as activated carbon adsorption, advanced oxidation processes, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, and membrane bioreactors can achieve higher and more consistent micropollutant removal. However, regardless of what technology is employed, the removal of micropollutants depends on physico-chemical properties of micropollutants and treatment conditions.

We investigated the prevalence and characteristics of L. monocytogenes isolates from surface waters derived from catchments within the South Nation River watershed (Ontario, Canada). This watershed is dominated by urban and rural development, livestock and crop production, and wildlife habitats. From June to November 2005, a total of 314 surface water samples were collected biweekly from 22 discrete sampling sites characterized by various upstream land uses. Presumptive Listeria spp. were isolated using a selective enrichment and isolation procedure, and 75 L. monocytogenes isolates were identified based on colony morphology, hemolytic activity, and amplification of three pathogenicity genes: iap, inlA, and hlyA. Thirty-two of 314 (10{\%}) surface water samples were positive for the presence of L. monocytogenes, but detection ranged between 0 and 27{\%} depending on the sampling date. Isolates belonging to serovar group 1/2a, 3a (50{\%}) and group 4b, 4d, 4e (32{\%}) were dominant. L. monocytogenes populations were resolved into 13 EcoRI ribotypes and 21 ApaI and 21 AscI pulsotypes. These had Simpson indexes of discrimination of up to 0.885. Lineage I-related isolates were dominant (61{\%}) during the summer, whereas lineage II isolates were dominant (77{\%}) in the fall. Isolates were, on average, resistant to 6.1 +/- 2.1 antibiotics out of 17 tested. Half of the L. monocytogenes isolates exhibited potential virulence linked to the production of a functional internalin A, and some isolates were found to be moderately to highly virulent by in vitro Caco-2 plaque formation assay (up to 28{\%} of entry). There was a statistically significant link between the occurrence of L. monocytogenes and proximity to an upstream dairy farm and degree of cropped land. Our data indicate that L. monocytogenes is widespread in the studied catchments, where it could represent a public health issue related to agricultural land use.},

The basin is composed of mixed but primarily agricultural land uses. From March 2004 to November 2007, a total of 2,004 surface water samples were collected from 24 sampling sites. E. coli densities ranged from undetectable to 1.64 x 10(5) CFU 100 ml(-1) and were correlated with stream order and proximity to livestock production systems. The diversity of 21,307 E. coli isolates was characterized using repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR), allowing for the identification of as many as 7,325 distinct genotypes, without capturing all of the diversity. The community was temporally and spatially dominated by a few dominant genotypes (clusters of more than 500 isolates) and several genotypes of intermediary abundance (clustering between 10 and 499 isolates). Simpson diversity indices, assessed on a normalized number of isolates per sample, ranged from 0.050 to 0.668. Simpson indices could be statistically discriminated on the basis of year and stream order, but land use, discharge, weather, and water physical-chemical properties were not statistically important discriminators. The detection of Campylobacter species was associated with statistically lower Simpson indices (greater diversity; P {\textless} 0.05). Waterborne E. coli isolates from genotypes of dominant and intermediary abundance were clustered with isolates obtained from fecal samples collected in the study area over the same period, and 90{\%} of the isolates tested proved to share genotypes with fecal isolates. Overall, our data indicated that the densities and distribution of E. coli in these mixed-use watersheds were linked to stream order and livestock-based land uses. Waterborne E. coli populations that were distinct from fecal isolates were detected and, on this basis, were possibly naturalized E. coli strains.},

However, there is also an important ecological legacy regarding the use of antibiotics and the consequences of increased levels of these compounds in the environment as a consequence of their use and disposal. This legacy was investigated by quantifying two antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) conferring resistance to tetracycline (tet(W)) and sulfonamide (sul1) in bacterial seed bank DNA in sediments. The industrial introduction of antibiotics caused an abrupt increase in the total abundance of tet(W) and a steady increase in sul1. The abrupt change in tet(W) corresponded to an increase in relative abundance from ca. 1960 that peaked around 1976. This pattern of accumulation was highly correlated with the abundance of specific members of the seed bank community belonging to the phylum Firmicutes. In contrast, the relative abundance of sul1 increased after 1976. This correlated with a taxonomically broad spectrum of bacteria, reflecting sul1 dissemination through horizontal gene transfer. The accumulation patterns of both ARGs correspond broadly to the temporal scale of medical antibiotic use. Our results show that the bacterial seed bank can be used to look back at the historical usage of antibiotics and resistance prevalence.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Farm disinfectants are widely used in primary production, but questions have been raised if their use can select for antimicrobial resistance. The present study examined the use of disinfectants in poultry and pig husbandry and its contribution to the antibiotic and disinfectant susceptibility of Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains obtained after cleaning and disinfection. On those field isolates antibiotic susceptibility was monitored and susceptibility to commonly used active components of farm disinfectants (i.e. glutaraldehyde, benzalkoniumchloride, formaldehyde, and a formulation of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide) was tested.

RESULTS

This study showed a high resistance prevalence ({\textgreater} 50{\%}) for ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and tetracycline for both production animal categories, while for ciprofloxacin only a high resistance prevalence was found in broiler houses. Disinfectant susceptibility results were homogenously distributed within a very small concentration range. Furthermore, all E. coli strains were susceptible to in-use concentrations of formaldehyde, benzalkoniumchloride and a formulation of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, indicating that the practical use of disinfectants did not select for disinfectant resistance. Moreover, the results showed no indications for the selection of antibiotic resistant bacteria through the use of disinfectants in agricultural environments.

CONCLUSION

Our study suggests that the proper use of disinfectants in agricultural environments does not promote antibiotic resistance nor reduce E. coli disinfectant susceptibility.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Quaternary ammonium compound based disinfectants are commonly used in pig and poultry husbandry to maintain farm hygiene. However, studies have shown that subinhibitory concentrations of these disinfectants may increase antibiotic resistance. Investigation of antibiotic susceptibility is usually assessed via the microbroth dilution method, although this conventional culture-based technique only provides information on the bacteriostatic activity of an antimicrobial agent. Therefore, experiments were performed to investigate the effect of prior benzalkonium chloride (BKC) exposure on the viability of subsequent ciprofloxacin (CIP) treated Escherichia coli.

RESULTS

Following CIP treatment, bacterial cell counts were significantly higher after exposure to a subinhibitory BKC concentration than without BKC exposure. The flow cytometric results suggested a BKC-dependent onset of membrane damage and loss of membrane potential.

CONCLUSION

Our results indicate a lower bactericidal effect of CIP treatment on BKC-exposed E. coli isolates compared to unexposed E. coli isolates.},

While most One Health attention has been on the potential for antibiotic resistance transmission from livestock and contaminated meat products to people, plant foods are fundamental to the food chain for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. We hypothesized that environmental bacteria that colonize plant foods may serve as platforms for the persistence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and for horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic-resistant genes. Donor Acinetobacter baylyi and recipient Escherichia coli were cocultured in vitro, in planta on lettuce, and in vivo in BALB/c mice. We showed that nonpathogenic, environmental A. baylyi is capable of transferring plasmids conferring antibiotic resistance to E. coli clinical isolates on lettuce leaf discs. Furthermore, transformant E. coli from the in planta assay could then colonize the mouse gut microbiome. The target antibiotic resistance plasmid was identified in mouse feces up to 5 days postinfection. We specifically identified in vivo transfer of the plasmid to resident Klebsiella pneumoniae in the mouse gut. Our findings highlight the potential for environmental bacteria exposed to antibiotics to transmit resistance genes to mammalian pathogens during ingestion of leafy greens.IMPORTANCE Previous efforts have correlated antibiotic-fed livestock and meat products with respective antibiotic resistance genes, but virtually no research has been conducted on the transmission of antibiotic resistance from plant foods to the mammalian gut (C. S. H{\"o}lzel, J. L. Tetens, and K. Schwaiger, Pathog Dis 15:671-688, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2018.2501; C. M. Liu et al., mBio 9:e00470-19, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00470-18; B.

Here, we sought to determine if horizontal transmission of antibiotic resistance genes can occur between lettuce and the mammalian gut microbiome, using a mouse model. Furthermore, we have created a new model to study horizontal gene transfer on lettuce leaves using an antibiotic-resistant transformant of A. baylyi (AbzeoR).},

In addition, a 30-d laboratory experiment was undertaken with the same soil and same pharmaceuticals, but at concentrations of 100 mg/kg soil. The impact of the pharmaceuticals on nitrification rates, on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) was assessed.

Referenced to control soil, nitrification was accelerated in soil exposed to 100 mg/kg zinc bacitracin or 10 mg/kg of the pharmaceutical mixture, but none of the treatments inhibited nitrification. Neither AOB abundance nor AOA abundance was affected by the pharmaceuticals at 0.1 mg/kg. At 10 mg/kg, monensin, zinc bacitracin, and a mixture of all 3 pharmaceuticals suppressed the abundance of AOB, and zinc bacitracin and the mixture increased AOA abundance. The decrease in AOB abundance and increase in AOA abundance when exposed to 10 mg/kg soil suggests that AOB are more sensitive to these chemicals and that AOA populations can expand to occupy the partially vacated niche.},

We link the genomic analysis to a phenotypic resistance screen and pinpoint genomic hot spots, which correlate with a resistance phenotype. Besides well-known resistance genes, this forward genomics approach generates many novel genes, which correlated with resistance and which are partly completely unknown. A surprising overall finding of our analyses is that we do not see any difference in resistance and pan genome size between isolates taken from the inflow of the treatment plant and from the outflow. This means that while treatment plants reduce the amount of bacteria released into the environment, they do not reduce the potential for antibiotic resistance of these bacteria.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Understanding the factors regulating our microbiota is important but requires appropriate statistical methodology. When comparing two or more populations most existing approaches either discount the underlying compositional structure in the microbiome data or use probability models such as the multinomial and Dirichlet-multinomial distributions, which may impose a correlation structure not suitable for microbiome data.

OBJECTIVE

To develop a methodology that accounts for compositional constraints to reduce false discoveries in detecting differentially abundant taxa at an ecosystem level, while maintaining high statistical power.

METHODS

We introduced a novel statistical framework called analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM). ANCOM accounts for the underlying structure in the data and can be used for comparing the composition of microbiomes in two or more populations. ANCOM makes no distributional assumptions and can be implemented in a linear model framework to adjust for covariates as well as model longitudinal data. ANCOM also scales well to compare samples involving thousands of taxa.

RESULTS

We compared the performance of ANCOM to the standard t-test and a recently published methodology called Zero Inflated Gaussian (ZIG) methodology (1) for drawing inferences on the mean taxa abundance in two or more populations. ANCOM controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) at the desired nominal level while also improving power, whereas the t-test and ZIG had inflated FDRs, in some instances as high as 68{\%} for the t-test and 60{\%} for ZIG. We illustrate the performance of ANCOM using two publicly available microbial datasets in the human gut, demonstrating its general applicability to testing hypotheses about compositional differences in microbial communities.

CONCLUSION

Accounting for compositionality using log-ratio analysis results in significantly improved inference in microbiota survey data.},

This absence of a taxonomic context makes binning a very challenging task. Limitations of current sequencing platforms, with respect to short read lengths and sequencing errors/artifacts, are also key factors that determine the overall binning efficiency. Furthermore, the sheer volume of metagenomic datasets also demands highly efficient algorithms that can operate within reasonable requirements of compute power. This review discusses the premise, methodologies, advantages, limitations and challenges of various methods available for binning of metagenomic datasets obtained using the shotgun sequencing approach.

Hospital wastewaters contain fecal material from a large number of individuals, of which many are undergoing antibiotic therapy. It is, thus, plausible that hospital wastewaters could provide opportunities to find novel carbapenemases and other resistance genes not yet described in clinical strains. Our aim was therefore to investigate the microbiota and antibiotic resistome of hospital effluent collected from the city of Mumbai, India, with a special focus on identifying novel carbapenemases.

RESULTS

Shotgun metagenomics revealed a total of 112 different mobile antibiotic resistance gene types, conferring resistance against almost all classes of antibiotics. Beta-lactamase genes, including encoding clinically important carbapenemases, such as NDM, VIM, IMP, KPC, and OXA-48, were abundant. NDM (0.9{\%} relative abundance to 16S rRNA genes) was the most common carbapenemase gene, followed by OXA-58 (0.84{\%} relative abundance to 16S rRNA genes). Among the investigated mobile genetic elements, class 1 integrons (11{\%} relative abundance to 16S rRNA genes) were the most abundant. The genus Acinetobacter accounted for as many as 30{\%} of the total 16S rRNA reads, with A. baumannii accounting for an estimated 2.5{\%}. High throughput sequencing of amplified integron gene cassettes identified a novel functional variant of an IMP-type (proposed IMP-81) carbapenemase gene (eight aa substitutions) along with recently described novel resistance genes like sul4 and blaRSA1. Using a computational hidden Markov model, we detected 27 unique metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) genes in the shotgun data, of which nine were novel subclass B1 genes, one novel subclass B2, and 10 novel subclass B3 genes. Six of the seven novel MBL genes were functional when expressed in Escherichia coli.

CONCLUSION

By exploring hospital wastewater from India, our understanding of the diversity of carbapenemases has been extended. The study also demonstrates that the microbiota of hospital wastewater can serve as a reservoir of novel resistance genes, including previously uncharacterized carbapenemases with the potential to spread further.},

The dynamics, balance, and effects of these communities are strongly influenced by phages present in the population. Being able to characterize bacterium-phage relationships is therefore essential to investigate these ecosystems to the full extent of their complexity. However, this task is currently limited by (i) the ability to characterize complete bacterial and viral genomes from a complex mix of species and (ii) the difficulty to assign phage sequences to their bacterial hosts. We show that both limitations can be circumvented using meta3C, an experimental and computational approach that exploits the physical contacts between DNA molecules to infer their proximity. In a single experiment, dozens of bacterial and phage genomes present in a complex mouse gut microbiota were assembled and scaffolded de novo. The phage genomes were then assigned to their putative bacterial hosts according to the physical contacts between the different DNA molecules, opening new perspectives for a comprehensive picture of the genomic structure of the gut flora. Therefore, this work holds far-reaching implications for human health studies aiming to bridge the virome to the microbiome.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Antibiotic resistance is rendering common bacterial infections untreatable. Wildlife can incorporate and disperse antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment, such as water systems, which in turn serve as reservoirs of resistance genes for human pathogens. Anthropogenic activity may contribute to the spread of bacterial resistance cycling through natural environments, including through the release of human waste, as sewage treatment only partially removes antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, empirical data supporting these effects are currently limited. Here we used bulk RNA-sequencing (meta-transcriptomics) to assess the diversity and expression levels of functionally viable resistance genes in the gut microbiome of birds with aquatic habits in diverse locations.

RESULTS

We found antibiotic resistance genes in birds from all localities, from penguins in Antarctica to ducks in a wastewater treatment plant in Australia. Comparative analysis revealed that birds feeding at the wastewater treatment plant carried the greatest resistance gene burden, including genes typically associated with multidrug resistance plasmids as the aac(6)-Ib-cr gene. Differences in resistance gene burden also reflected aspects of bird ecology, taxonomy, and microbial function. Notably, ducks, which feed by dabbling, carried a higher abundance and diversity of resistance genes than turnstones, avocets, and penguins, which usually prey on more pristine waters.

CONCLUSIONS

These transcriptome data suggest that human waste, even if it undergoes treatment, might contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes to the wild. Differences in microbiome functioning across different bird lineages may also play a role in the antibiotic resistance burden carried by wild birds. In summary, we reveal the complex factors explaining the distribution of resistance genes and their exchange routes between humans and wildlife, and show that meta-transcriptomics is a valuable tool to access functional resistance genes in whole microbial communities.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Clostridium botulinum produces seven distinct serotypes of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs). The genes encoding different subtype neurotoxins of serotypes A, B, F and several dual neurotoxin-producing strains have been shown to reside on plasmids, suggesting that intra- and interspecies transfer of BoNT-encoding plasmids may occur. The objective of the present study was to determine whether these C. botulinum BoNT-encoding plasmids are conjugative.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS

C. botulinum BoNT-encoding plasmids pBotCDC-A3 (strain CDC-A3), pCLJ (strain 657Ba) and pCLL (strain Eklund 17B) were tagged with the erythromycin resistance marker (Erm) using the ClosTron mutagenesis system by inserting a group II intron into the neurotoxin genes carried on these plasmids. Transfer of the tagged plasmids from the donor strains CDC-A3, 657Ba and Eklund 17B to tetracycline-resistant recipient C. botulinum strains was evaluated in mating experiments. Erythromycin and tetracycline resistant transconjugants were isolated from donor:recipient mating pairs tested. Transfer of the plasmids to the transconjugants was confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Southern hybridizations. Transfer required cell-to-cell contact and was DNase resistant. This indicates that transfer of these plasmids occurs via a conjugation mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE

This is the first evidence supporting conjugal transfer of native botulinum neurotoxin-encoding plasmids in C. botulinum, and provides a probable mechanism for the lateral distribution of BoNT-encoding plasmids to other C. botulinum strains. The potential transfer of C. botulinum BoNT-encoding plasmids to other bacterial hosts in the environment or within the human intestine is of great concern for human pathogenicity and necessitates further characterization of these plasmids.},

The provision of antibiotics to food animals encompasses a wide variety of nontherapeutic purposes that include growth promotion. The concern over resistance emergence and spread to people by nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials has led to conflicted practices and opinions. Considerable evidence supported the removal of nontherapeutic antimicrobials (NTAs) in Europe, based on the {\textquotedbl}precautionary principle.{\textquotedbl} Still, concrete scientific evidence of the favorable versus unfavorable consequences of NTAs is not clear to all stakeholders. Substantial data show elevated antibiotic resistance in bacteria associated with animals fed NTAs and their food products. This resistance spreads to other animals and humans-directly by contact and indirectly via the food chain, water, air, and manured and sludge-fertilized soils. Modern genetic techniques are making advances in deciphering the ecological impact of NTAs, but modeling efforts are thwarted by deficits in key knowledge of microbial and antibiotic loads at each stage of the transmission chain. Still, the substantial and expanding volume of evidence reporting animal-to-human spread of resistant bacteria, including that arising from use of NTAs, supports eliminating NTA use in order to reduce the growing environmental load of resistance genes.},

The present study evaluated the complement of bacteria resistant to various antibiotics on vegetables often eaten raw (tomato, cucumber, pepper, carrot, radish, lettuce) and how this might vary with growth in soil fertilized inorganically or with dairy or swine manure. Vegetables were sown into field plots immediately following fertilization and harvested when of marketable quality. Vegetable and soil samples were evaluated for viable antibiotic-resistant bacteria by plate count on Chromocult medium supplemented with antibiotics at clinical breakpoint concentrations. DNA was extracted from soil and vegetables and evaluated by PCR for the presence of 46 gene targets associated with plasmid incompatibility groups, integrons, or antibiotic resistance genes. Soil receiving manure was enriched in antibiotic-resistant bacteria and various antibiotic resistance determinants. There was no coherent corresponding increase in the abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria enumerated from any vegetable grown in manure-fertilized soil. Numerous antibiotic resistance determinants were detected in DNA extracted from vegetables grown in unmanured soil. A smaller number of determinants were additionally detected on vegetables grown only in manured and not in unmanured soil. Overall, consumption of raw vegetables represents a route of human exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance determinants naturally present in soil. However, the detection of some determinants on vegetables grown only in freshly manured soil reinforces the advisability of pretreating manure through composting or other stabilization processes or mandating offset times between manuring and harvesting vegetables for human consumption.},

The present study evaluated the fate in soil of selected genes associated with antibiotic resistance or genetic mobility in field plots cropped to vegetables and managed according to normal farming practice. Referenced to unmanured soil, fertilization with swine or dairy manure increased the relative abundance of the gene targets sul1, erm(B), str(B), int1, and IncW repA. Following manure application in the spring of 2012, gene copy number decayed exponentially, reaching background levels by the fall of 2012. In contrast, gene copy number following manure application in the fall of 2012 or spring of 2013 increased significantly in the weeks following application and then declined. In both cases, the relative abundance of gene copy numbers had not returned to background levels by the fall of 2013. Overall, these results suggest that under conditions characteristic of agriculture in a humid continental climate, a 1-year period following a commercial application of raw manure is sufficient to ensure that an additional soil burden of antibiotic resistance genes approaches background. The relative abundance of several gene targets exceeded background during the growing season following a spring application or an application done the previous fall. Results from the present study reinforce the advisability of treating manure prior to use in crop production systems.},

 abstract = {The complete 108,845-nucleotide sequence of catabolic plasmid pADP-1 from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP was determined. Plasmid pADP-1 was previously shown to encode AtzA, AtzB, and AtzC, which catalyze the sequential hydrolytic removal of s-triazine ring substituents from the herbicide atrazine to yield cyanuric acid. Computational analyses indicated that pADP-1 encodes 104 putative open reading frames (ORFs), which are predicted to function in catabolism, transposition, and plasmid maintenance, transfer, and replication. Regions encoding transfer and replication functions of pADP-1 had 80 to 100{\%} amino acid sequence identity to pR751, an IncPbeta plasmid previously isolated from Enterobacter aerogenes. pADP-1 was shown to contain a functional mercury resistance operon with 99{\%} identity to Tn5053. Complete copies of transposases with 99{\%} amino acid sequence identity to TnpA from IS1071 and TnpA from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes were identified and flank each of the atzA, atzB, and atzC genes, forming structures resembling nested catabolic transposons. Functional analyses identified three new catabolic genes, atzD, atzE, and atzF, which participate in atrazine catabolism. Crude extracts from Escherichia coli expressing AtzD hydrolyzed cyanuric acid to biuret. AtzD showed 58{\%} amino acid sequence identity to TrzD, a cyanuric acid amidohydrolase, from Pseudomonas sp. strain NRRLB-12227. Two other genes encoding the further catabolism of cyanuric acid, atzE and atzF, reside in a contiguous cluster adjacent to a potential LysR-type transcriptional regulator. E. coli strains bearing atzE and atzF were shown to encode a biuret hydrolase and allophanate hydrolase, respectively. atzDEF are cotranscribed. AtzE and AtzF are members of a common amidase protein family. These data reveal the complete structure of a catabolic plasmid and show that the atrazine catabolic genes are dispersed on three disparate regions of the plasmid. These results begin to provide insight into how plasmids are structured, and thus evolve, to encode the catabolism of compounds recently added to the biosphere.},

One important and frequently forgotten aspect of antibiotics and their resistance genes is that they evolved in non-clinical (natural) environments before the use of antibiotics by humans. Given that the biosphere is mainly formed by micro-organisms, learning the functional role of antibiotics and their resistance elements in nature has relevant implications both for human health and from an ecological perspective. Recent works have suggested that some antibiotics may serve for signalling purposes at the low concentrations probably found in natural ecosystems, whereas some antibiotic resistance genes were originally selected in their hosts for metabolic purposes or for signal trafficking. However, the high concentrations of antibiotics released in specific habitats (for instance, clinical settings) as a consequence of human activity can shift those functional roles. The pollution of natural ecosystems by antibiotics and resistance genes might have consequences for the evolution of the microbiosphere. Whereas antibiotics produce transient and usually local challenges in microbial communities, antibiotic resistance genes present in gene-transfer units can spread in nature with consequences for human health and the evolution of environmental microbiota that are largely ignored.},

Here we sequenced and characterized high-molecular-weight plasmids from a bacterial collection of an on-farm BPS. The high-throughput-sequencing of the plasmid pool yielded a total of several Mb sequence information. Assembly of the sequence data resulted in six complete replicons. Using in silico analyses we identified plasmid replication genes whose encoding proteins represent 13 different Pfam families, as well as proteins involved in plasmid conjugation, indicating a large diversity of plasmid replicons and suggesting the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events within the habitat analyzed. In addition, genes conferring resistance to 10 classes of antimicrobial compounds and those encoding enzymes potentially involved in pesticide and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation were found.

 abstract = {Antibiotics have a wide application range in human and veterinary medicines. Being designed for pharmacological stability, most antibiotics are recalcitrant to biodegradation after ingestion and can be persistent in the environment. Antibiotic residues have been detected as contaminants in various environmental compartments where they cause human and environmental threats, notably with respect to the potential emergence and proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. An important component of managing environmental risk caused by antibiotics is to understand exposure of soil and water resources to their residues. One challenge is to gain knowledge on the fate of antibiotics in the ecosystem along the soil-water continuum, and on the collateral impact of antibiotics on environmental microorganisms responsible for crucially important ecosystem functions. In this context, the ANTIBIOTOX project aims at studying the environmental fate and impact of two antibiotics of the sulfonamide class of antibiotics, sulfamethazine (SMZ), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX).},

 abstract = {The central aims of many host or environmental microbiome studies are to elucidate factors associated with microbial community compositions and to relate microbial features to outcomes. However, these aims are often complicated by difﬁculties stemming from high-dimensionality, non-normality, sparsity, and the compositional nature of microbiome data sets. A key tool in microbiome analysis is beta diversity, deﬁned by the distances between microbial samples. Many different distance metrics have been proposed, all with varying discriminatory power on data with differing characteristics. Here, we propose a compositional beta diversity metric rooted in a centered log-ratio transformation and matrix completion called robust Aitchison PCA. We demonstrate the beneﬁts of compositional transformations upstream of beta diversity calculations through simulations. Additionally, we demonstrate improved effect size, classiﬁcation accuracy, and robustness to sequencing depth over the current methods on several decreased sample subsets of real microbiome data sets. Finally, we highlight the ability of this new beta diversity metric to retain the feature loadings linked to sample ordinations revealing salient intercommunity niche feature importance.},

In this study we examined three commercial poultry farms to correlate the co-occurrence patterns of antibiotic and metal residues to the presence of ARGs. We quantified 283 ARGs, 12 mobile genetic elements (MGEs), 49 targeted antibiotics, 7 heavy metals and sequenced 16S rRNA genes. The abundance and type of ARG were significantly enriched in manure while soil harbored the most diverse bacterial community. Procrustes analysis displayed significant correlations between ARGs/MGEs and the microbiome. Cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) were responsible for a majority of positive correlations to ARGs when compared to antibiotics. Integrons and transposons co-occurred with ARGs corresponding to 9 classes of antibiotics, especially Class1 integrase intI-1LC. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that antibiotics, metals, MGEs and bacteria explain solely 0.7{\%}, 5.7{\%}, 12.4{\%}, and 21.9{\%} of variances of ARGs in the microbial community, respectively. These results suggested that bacterial composition and horizontal gene transfer were the major factors shaping the composition of ARGs; Metals had a bigger effect on ARG profile than detected antibiotics in this study.},

 abstract = {An analytical method was developed for determining macrolide antibiotics in treated wastewater effluents and in ambient water based on solid-phase extraction and LC/MS analysis as well as on LC/MS/MS for structural confirmation. In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) macrolides are only partly eliminated and can therefore reach the aquatic environment. In treated effluents from three WWTPs in Switzerland, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and erythromycin-H2O, the main degradation product of erythromycin, were found. The most abundant, clarithromycin, reflects the consumption pattern of macrolide antibiotics. Summer concentrations of clarithromycin varied between 57 and 330 ng/L in treated WWTP effluents. In the WWTP Kloten-Opfikon seasonal differences revealed a load two times higher in winter than in summer. The higher abundance of erythromycin-H2O in the effluent of WWTP Kloten-Opfikon can be explained by distinct consumption patterns due to the main international airport of Switzerland in the catchment area. In the Glatt River clarithromycin reached concentrations of up to 75 ng/L. Mass flux determinations in treated effluents and in river water in the Glatt Valley watershed showed that elimination of clarithromycin along the river stretch of 36 km is insignificant ({\textless}20{\%}). Investigations in the Glatt River before and after the diversion of the largest WWTP revealed an observable decrease in clarithromycin loads.},

Current concern that the increased use of such biocides in consumer products might contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance has led us to examine the effects of a QAC-containing domestic cleaning fluid on the population dynamics and antimicrobial susceptibility of domestic sink drain biofilm communities. QAC susceptibilities of numerically dominant, culturable drain bacteria (15 genera, 17 species) were determined in vitro before and after repeated QAC exposure (14 passages). A fully characterized drain microcosm was then exposed to short-term (12 days) and long-term (3 months) dosing with a QAC-containing domestic detergent (QD). QAC exposure of isolated cultures caused both increases (three species) and circa twofold decreases (six species) in QAC susceptibility. The susceptibility of Ralstonia sp. was considerably decreased following 14 consecutive QAC passages. Control drain microcosm biofilms maintained dynamic stability, as evidenced by culture and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Bacterial population densities were largely unaffected during short-term exposure to use levels of QD, although 50{\%} QD caused circa 10-fold viability reductions. DGGE analysis supported these observations; identified the major microcosm genera as Pseudomonas, Pseudoalteromonas, Erwinia, and Enterobacter, and showed that aeromonads increased in abundance under 10 to 50{\%} QD. Long-term exposure of the microcosms to QD did not significantly alter the pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility. These data demonstrate the recalcitrance of domestic drain biofilms toward QAC and that although repeated QAC exposure of drain isolates in pure culture results in susceptibility change in some test bacteria, such changes do not necessarily occur within complex communities.},

Composite samples of archived biosolids, collected at 94 U.S. wastewater treatment plants from 32 states and the District of Columbia, were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using EPA Method 1694. Thirty-eight (54{\%}) of the 72 analytes were detected in at least one composite sample at concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 48 mg kg(-1) dry weight. Triclocarban and triclosan were the most abundant analytes with mean concentrations of 36 +/- 8 and 12.6 +/- 3.8 mg kg(-1) (n = 5), respectively, accounting for 65{\%} of the total PPCP mass found. The loading to U.S. soils from nationwide biosolids recycling was estimated at 210-250 metric tons per year for the sum of the 72 PPCPs investigated. The results of this nationwide reconnaissance of PPCPs in archived U.S. biosolids mirror in contaminant occurrences, frequencies and concentrations, those reported by the U.S. EPA for samples collected in 2006/2007. This demonstrates that PPCP releases in U.S. biosolids have been ongoing for many years and the most abundant PPCPs appear to show limited fluctuations in mass over time when assessed on a nationwide basis. The here demonstrated use of five mega composite samples holds promise for conducting cost-effective, routine monitoring on a regional and national basis.},

The objective of this study was to investigate how individual treatment steps in two tertiary WWTPs affected the removal (copies/mL) and relative abundance of ARGs (copies/copies 16S rRNA genes). Nine ARG markers, representing resistance to commonly used antibiotics, as well as one integron gene (intl1) to assess ARG mobility potential, were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Both WWTPs met provincial effluent regulations for removal of carbonaceous oxygen demand (CBOD5) and total suspended solids. Eight of the ten ARG markers (intl1, sul1, sul2, tet(O), ermB, blaCTX-M, blaTEM, qnrS) were detected in all samples. In contrast, mecA was detected intermittently and vanA remained below the detection limit in all samples. The total ARG marker abundances decreased by log 1.77 (p {\textless} 0.05) in the plant using an aerated lagoon (AL), and by 2.69 logs (p {\textless} 0.05) through treatment in the plant employing a biological nutrient removal (BNR) system. The BNR and secondary clarifier steps in both plants afforded the most removal of ARGs. The relative abundance of ARGs remained unchanged at the AL plant and showed a decreasing trend at the BNR plant. Levels of CBOD5, nitrate and the human Bacteroides fecal marker correlated with ARG concentrations, suggesting these variables may be useful in predicting ARG removal. In conclusion, the effluent coming from the WWTPs contained eight of the studied ARG markers in concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 3.6 log copies/mL, indicating their release into the environment, however, the relative abundance of ARGs was not enriched during treatment in the two WWTPs.},

But the measurements they provide differ from the truth, often dramatically, because these experiments are biased toward detecting some taxa over others. This experimental bias makes the taxon or gene abundances measured by different protocols quantitatively incomparable and can lead to spurious biological conclusions. We propose a mathematical model for how bias distorts community measurements based on the properties of real experiments. We validate this model with 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics data from defined bacterial communities. Our model better fits the experimental data despite being simpler than previous models. We illustrate how our model can be used to evaluate protocols, to understand the effect of bias on downstream statistical analyses, and to measure and correct bias given suitable calibration controls. These results illuminate new avenues toward truly quantitative and reproducible metagenomics measurements.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

the analysis of microbial communities through dna sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data.

RESULTS

Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research.

For apparently historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is available that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability using an appropriate mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called metagenomeSeq. We find that metagenomeSeq performs well when there is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

We hypothesized that triclosan enriches for Dehalococcoides-like Chloroflexi because these bacteria respire organochlorides and are likely less sensitive, relative to other bacteria, to the antimicrobial effects of triclosan. Triplicate anaerobic soil microcosms were seeded with agricultural soil, which was not previously exposed to triclosan, and were amended with 1 mg kg(-1) of triclosan. Triplicate control microcosms did not receive triclosan, and the experiment was run for 618 days. The overall bacterial community (assessed by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) was not impacted by triclosan; however, the abundance of Dehalococcoides-like Chloroflexi 16S rRNA genes (determined by qPCR) increased 20-fold with triclosan amendment compared with a fivefold increase without triclosan. This work demonstrates that triclosan impacts anaerobic soil communities at environmentally relevant levels.},

Understanding how bacteria resist antimicrobial treatment and regulate gene expression in response to antibiotics is an important step towards combating resistance. In this review we focus on a ubiquitous class of bacterial gene regulators termed regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) and how they contribute to antimicrobial resistance and tolerance. Small RNAs have notable roles in modulating the composition of the bacterial envelope, and through these functions control intrinsic antimicrobial resistance in many human pathogens. Recent technical advances that allow profiling of the 'sRNA interactome' have revealed a complex post-transcriptional network of sRNA interactions that can be used to identify network hubs and regulatory bottlenecks. Sequence-specific inhibition of these sRNAs with programmable RNA-targeting therapeutics may present avenues for treating antimicrobial resistant pathogens or resensitizing to our current antibiotics.},

The SMB is highly sensitive and specific, but it is expensive and time-consuming and there are ethical concerns due to use of laboratory animals. PCR provides a rapid alternative for initial screening for BoNT-producing clostridia. In this study, a previously described multiplex PCR assay was modified to detect all type A, B, E, and F neurotoxin genes in isolated strains and in clinical, food, environmental samples. This assay includes an internal amplification control. The effectiveness of the multiplex PCR method for detecting clostridia possessing type A, B, E, and F neurotoxin genes was evaluated by direct comparison with the SMB. This method showed 100{\%} inclusivity and 100{\%} exclusivity when 182 BoNT-producing clostridia and 21 other bacterial strains were used. The relative accuracy of the multiplex PCR and SMB was evaluated using 532 clinical, food, and environmental samples and was estimated to be 99.2{\%}.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a One Health problem impacted by antimicrobial use (AMU) for human and livestock applications. Extensive Iberian swine production is based on a more sustainable and eco-friendly management system, providing an excellent opportunity to evaluate how sustained differences in AMU impact the resistome, not only in the animals but also on the farm environment. Here, we evaluate the resistome footprint of an extensive pig farming system, maintained for decades, as compared to that of industrialized intensive pig farming by analyzing 105 fecal, environmental and slurry metagenomes from 38 farms.

RESULTS

Our results evidence a significantly higher abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) on intensive farms and a link between AMU and AMR to certain antimicrobial classes. We observed differences in the resistome across sample types, with a higher richness and dispersion of ARGs within environmental samples than on those from feces or slurry. Indeed, a deeper analysis revealed that differences among the three sample types were defined by taxa-ARGs associations. Interestingly, mobilome analyses revealed that the observed AMR differences between intensive and extensive farms could be linked to differences in the abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Thus, while there were no differences in the abundance of chromosomal-associated ARGs between intensive and extensive herds, a significantly higher abundance of integrons in the environment and plasmids, regardless of the sample type, was detected on intensive farms.

CONCLUSIONS

Overall, this study shows how AMU, production system, and sample type influence, mainly through MGEs, the profile and dispersion of ARGs in pig production. Video Abstract.},

To identify the genetic basis and pathways implicated in the biocide stress response, we exposed Escherichia coli populations to 10 ubiquitous biocides. By comparing the transcriptional responses between a short-term exposure (30 min) and a long-term exposure (8 to 12 h) to biocide stress, we established the common gene and pathway clusters that are implicated in general and biocide-specific stress responses. Our analysis revealed a temporal choreography, starting from the upregulation of chaperones to the subsequent repression of motility and chemotaxis pathways and the induction of an anaerobic pool of enzymes and biofilm regulators. A systematic analysis of the transcriptional data identified a zur-regulated gene cluster to be highly active in the stress response against sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid, presenting a link between the biocide stress response and zinc homeostasis. Susceptibility assays with knockout mutants further validated our findings and provide clear targets for downstream investigation of the implicated mechanisms of action.IMPORTANCE Antiseptics and disinfectant products are of great importance to control and eliminate pathogens, especially in settings such as hospitals and the food industry.

Mex efflux pumps contribute to multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Evidencing their expression in clinical isolates would help in rationalizing antibiotic selection.

METHODS

We have developed a combined phenotypic and genotypic approach for the differential diagnosis of resistance mediated by four major transporters (MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, MexEF-OprN, MexXY-OprM). The methodology was validated using reference strains harbouring only one specific transporter and its applicability evaluated towards seven selected clinical isolates, the resistance mechanisms of which could not be assigned by conventional techniques. Phenotypic detection used MIC measurements with reporter antibiotics [carbenicillin (MexAB-OprM); erythromycin (MexCD-OprJ); norfloxacin and imipenem (MexEF-OprN); gentamicin (MexXY-OprM)] with and without Phe-Arg-beta-naphthylamide. Genotypic detection was made by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for mexC and mexE, and by quantitative competitive RT-PCR and real-time PCR for mexA and mexX (correlation between both methods: {\textgreater} 88 {\%} ; overexpression levels ranging between 4.8 and 8.1).

RESULTS

Convergence between phenotypic and genotypic methods was observed in control strains for all pumps. For clinical isolates, convergence was obtained in 6 of 7 strains for MexXY-OprM and MexEF-OprM, and in 5 of 7 for MexAB-OprM and MexCD-OprJ, mostly due to hard to interpret phenotypic data.

The data plead for combining phenotypic and genotypic approaches in the diagnosis of efflux-mediated resistance in P. aeruginosa.},

Thirty-one antimicrobials from the macrolide, quinolone, quinoxaline dioxide, sulfonamide, and tetracycline classes were investigated in the final (treated) effluents from eight WWTPs, located in five Canadian cities. Ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin-H20, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, and tetracycline were frequently detected in the effluents. The detection of sulfapyridine in effluents is the first report of this compound in environmental samples. Antimicrobials used exclusively for veterinary applications or treatment of livestock, such as carbadox, olaquindox, and chlortetracycline were not detected in the WWTP final effluents. There appear to be differences in the relative concentrations of antimicrobials detected in WWTP final effluents in Canada relative to concentrations reported previously in northern Europe, particularly for quinolone and sulfonamide compounds. These data may reflect differences in prescription patterns in Canada and northern Europe. The antimicrobials frequently detected in WWTP effluents appear to be those prescribed heavily in Canada for medical applications, and these compounds should be considered priority compounds for monitoring in surface water near WWTP discharges. The concentrations of antimicrobials detected in WWTP final effluents did not exceed 1 microg/L; levels that are unlikely to affect the growth and survival of aquatic organisms.},

To gain insight into this impact, we collected effluents from an azithromycin-manufacturing industry discharge site as well as upstream and downstream sediments from the receiving Sava river during both winter and summer season. Chemical analyses of sediment and effluent samples indicated that the effluent discharge significantly increased the amount of macrolide antibiotics, heavy metals and nutrients in the receiving river sediments. Quantitative PCR revealed a significant increase of relative abundances of macrolide-resistance genes and class 1 integrons in effluent-impacted sediments. Amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed spatial and seasonal bacterial community shifts in the receiving sediments. Redundancy analysis and Mantel test indicated that macrolides and copper together with nutrients significantly correlated with community shift close to the effluent discharge site. The number of taxa that were significantly increased in relative abundance at the discharge site decreased rapidly at the downstream sites, showing the resilience of the indigenous sediment bacterial community. Seasonal changes in the chemical properties of the sediment along with changes in effluent community composition could be responsible for sediment community shifts between winter and summer. Altogether, this study showed that the discharge of pharmaceutical effluents altered physicochemical characteristics and bacterial community of receiving river sediments, which contributed to the enrichment of macrolide-resistance genes and integrons.},

Here we analyzed formulation effluents and sediments from the receiving creek collected at the discharge site (DW0), upstream (UP) and 3000 m downstream of discharge (DW3000) during winter and summer season. Chemical analyses indicated the largest amounts of trimethoprim (up to 5.08 mg/kg) and azithromycin (up to 0.39 mg/kg) at DW0, but sulfonamides accumulated at DW3000 (total up to 1.17 mg/kg). Quantitative PCR revealed significantly increased relative abundance of various antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) against \textgreek{b}-lactams, macrolides, sulfonamides, trimethoprim and tetracyclines in sediments from DW0, despite relatively high background levels of some ARGs already at UP site. However, only sulfonamide (sul2) and macrolide ARG subtypes (mphG and msrE) were still elevated at DW3000 compared to UP. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed pronounced changes in the sediment bacterial community composition from both DW sites compared to UP site, regardless of the season. Numerous taxa with increased relative abundance at DW0 decreased to background levels at DW3000, suggesting die-off or lack of transport of effluent-originating bacteria. In contrast, various taxa that were more abundant in sediments than in effluents increased in relative abundance at DW3000 but not at DW0, possibly due to selection imposed by high sulfonamide levels. Network analysis revealed strong correlation between some clinically relevant ARGs (e.g. blaGES, blaOXA, ermB, tet39, sul2) and taxa with elevated abundance at DW sites, and known to harbour opportunistic pathogens, such as Acinetobacter, Arcobacter, Aeromonas and Shewanella.

 abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa achieves high-level (MIC{\textgreater}1 mg/ml) triclosan resistance either by constitutive expression of MexAB-OprM, an efflux pump of the resistance nodulation cell division (RND) family, or expression of MexCD-OprJ, MexEF-OprN, and MexJK-OpmH in regulatory mutants. A triclosan-resistant target enzyme and perhaps other mechanisms probably act synergistically with efflux. To probe this notion, we exposed the susceptible Delta(mexAB-oprM) Delta(mexCD-oprJ) Delta(mexEF-oprN) Delta(mexJK) Delta(mexXY) strain PAO509 to increasing triclosan concentrations and derived a resistant strain, PAO509.5. This mutant overexpressed the PA0156-PA0157-PA0158 pump, which only effluxed triclosan, but not closely related compounds, antibiotics, and divalent cations, and was therefore renamed TriABC. Constitutive expression of the triABC operon was due to a single promoter-up mutation. Deletion of two adjacent genes, pcaR and PA0159, encoding transcriptional regulators had no effect on expression of this operon. TriABC is the only P. aeruginosa RND pump which contains two membrane fusion proteins, TriA and TriB, and both are required for efflux pump function. Probably owing to tight transcriptional coupling of the triABC genes, complementation of individual mutations was only partially achievable. Full complementation was only observed when a complete triABC operon was provided in trans, either in single or multiple copies. TriABC associated with OpmH, but not OprM, for assembly of a functional triclosan efflux pump. TriABC is the fifth RND pump in P. aeruginosa shown to efficiently efflux triclosan, supporting the notion that efflux is the primary mechanism responsible for this bacterium's high intrinsic and acquired triclosan resistance.},

However, a growing number of reports suggest the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer, raising genealogical questions. Here we show the genetic interoperability and promiscuity of 16S rRNA in the ribosomes of an extremely thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus. The gene in this thermophile was systematically replaced with a diverse array of heterologous genes, resulting in the discovery of various genes that supported growth, some of which were from different phyla. Moreover, numerous functional chimeras were spontaneously generated. Remarkably, cold-adapted mutants were obtained carrying chimeric or full-length heterologous genes, indicating that horizontal gene transfer promoted adaptive evolution. The ribosome may well be understood as a patchworked supramolecule comprising patchworked components. We here propose the {\textquotedbl}random patch model{\textquotedbl} for ribosomal evolution.},

Perturbations to the gut ecosystem, such as through antibiotic treatment or diet, are at present interpreted at the level of bacterial phylogeny. Less is known about the contributions of the abundant population of phages to this ecological network. Here we explore the phageome as a potential genetic reservoir for bacterial adaptation by sequencing murine faecal phage populations following antibiotic perturbation. We show that antibiotic treatment leads to the enrichment of phage-encoded genes that confer resistance via disparate mechanisms to the administered drug, as well as genes that confer resistance to antibiotics unrelated to the administered drug, and we demonstrate experimentally that phages from treated mice provide aerobically cultured naive microbiota with increased resistance. Systems-wide analyses uncovered post-treatment phage-encoded processes related to host colonization and growth adaptation, indicating that the phageome becomes broadly enriched for functionally beneficial genes under stress-related conditions. We also show that antibiotic treatment expands the interactions between phage and bacterial species, leading to a more highly connected phage-bacterial network for gene exchange. Our work implicates the phageome in the emergence of multidrug resistance, and indicates that the adaptive capacity of the phageome may represent a community-based mechanism for protecting the gut microflora, preserving its functional robustness during antibiotic stress.},

 abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance poses a substantial threat to human health. The gut microbiome is considered a reservoir for potential spread of resistance genes from commensals to pathogens, termed the gut resistome. The impact of probiotics, commonly consumed by many in health or in conjunction with the administration of antibiotics, on the gut resistome is elusive. Reanalysis of gut metagenomes from healthy antibiotics-na{\"i}ve humans supplemented with an 11-probiotic-strain preparation, allowing direct assessment of the gut resistome in situ along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, demonstrated that probiotics reduce the number of antibiotic resistance genes exclusively in the gut of colonization-permissive individuals. In mice and in a separate cohort of humans, a course of antibiotics resulted in expansion of the lower GI tract resistome, which was mitigated by autologous faecal microbiome transplantation or during spontaneous recovery. In contrast, probiotics further exacerbated resistome expansion in the GI mucosa by supporting the bloom of strains carrying vancomycin resistance genes but not resistance genes encoded by the probiotic strains. Importantly, the aforementioned effects were not reflected in stool samples, highlighting the importance of direct sampling to analyse the effect of probiotics and antibiotics on the gut resistome. Analysing antibiotic resistance gene content in additional published clinical trials with probiotics further highlighted the importance of person-specific metagenomics-based profiling of the gut resistome using direct sampling. Collectively, these findings suggest opposing person-specific and antibiotic-dependent effects of probiotics on the resistome, whose contribution to the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes along the human GI tract merit further studies.},

This is even more so if we consider that the mobilome of environmental bacteria can be the reservoir of genes that may later appear in the clinic. Recently, new genera have been proposed in the family Mycobacteriaceae, including the genus Mycolicibacterium, which encompasses dozens of species of agricultural, biotechnological, clinical and ecological importance, being ubiquitous in several environments. The current scenario in the Mycobacteriaceae mobilome has some bias because most of the characterized mycobacteriophages were isolated using a single host strain, and the few plasmids reported mainly relate to the genus Mycobacterium. To fill in the gaps in these issues, we performed a systematic in silico study of these mobile elements based on 242 available genomes of the genus Mycolicibacterium. The analyses identified 156 putative plasmids (19 conjugative, 45 mobilizable and 92 non-mobilizable) and 566 prophages in 86 and 229 genomes, respectively. Moreover, a contig was characterized by resembling an actinomycete integrative and conjugative element (AICE). Within this diversity of mobile genetic elements, there is a pool of genes associated with several canonical functions, in addition to adaptive traits, such as virulence and resistance to antibiotics and metals (mercury and arsenic). The type-VII secretion system was a common feature in the predicted plasmids, being associated with genes encoding virulent proteins (EsxA, EsxB, PE and PPE). In addition to the characterization of plasmids and prophages of the family Mycobacteriaceae, this study showed an abundance of these genetic elements in a dozen species of the genus Mycolicibacterium.},

The presence and distribution of these genes have been anticipated to have a role in the survival and growth of L. monocytogenes in food processing environments where QAC based disinfectants are in common use. In this study, a panel of 680 L. monocytogenes from nine Norwegian meat- and salmon processing plants were grouped into 36 MLVA profiles. The presence of qacH and bcrABC was determined in 101 isolates from the 26 most common MLVA profiles. Five MLVA profiles contained qacH and two contained bcrABC. Isolates with qacH and bcrABC showed increased tolerance to the QAC Benzalkonium chloride (BC), with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5-12, 10-13 and {\textless}5ppm for strains with qacH (two allele variants observed), bcrABC, and neither gene, respectively. Isolates with qacH or bcrABC were not more tolerant to BC in bactericidal tests in suspension or in biofilms compared with isolates lacking the genes. Water residue samples collected from surfaces in meat processing plants after QAC disinfection had bactericidal effect against L. monocytogenes when the sample BC levels were high ({\textgreater}100ppm). A sample with lower BC concentrations (14ppm of chain length C-12 and 2.7ppm of chain length C-14) inhibited growth of L. monocytogenes not containing bcrABC or qacH, compared to strains with these genes. The study has shown that L. monocytogenes harbouring the QAC resistance genes qacH and bcrABC are prevalent in the food industry and that residuals of QAC may be present in concentrations after sanitation in the industry that result in a growth advantage for bacteria with such resistance genes.},

The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of six homologs of benzylalkylammonium chlorides (BAC) was determined in deionized water, 0.01~M CaCl2 solution, and aqueous soil extracts, using both spectrofluorometric and tensiometric methods. Additionally, eight organic model compounds were employed at concentrations of 15~mg C L-1 as background solutes in order to test the effect of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on CMCs. Results found CMCs decreased with an increasing length of the alkyl chain from 188~mM for BAC-C8 to 0.1~mM for BAC-C18. Both methods yielded similar results for measurements in water and CaCl2 solution; however, the spectrofluorescence method did not work for soil extracts due to fluorescence quenching phenomena. In soil extracts, CMCs of BAC-C12 were reduced below 3.7~mM, while the CMC reduction in soil extracts was less pronounced for BAC-C16. Besides ionic strength, molecular structures of BACs and dissolved organic compounds also affected the CMC. The number of carboxyl groups and small molecular weights of the DOC model compounds reduced the CMCs of BAC-C12 and BAC-C16 at pH~6. This study highlights that CMCs can be surpassed in soil solution, pore waters of sediments, or other natural waters even at (small) concentrations of QAACs typically found in the environment.},

Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria pose a serious threat in the clinic. This is particularly true for opportunistic pathogens that possess high intrinsic resistance. Though many studies have focused on understanding the acquisition of bacterial resistance upon exposure to antimicrobials, the mechanisms controlling intrinsic resistance are not well understood. In this study, we subjected the model opportunistic superbug Pseudomonas aeruginosa to 14 antimicrobials under highly controlled conditions and assessed its response using expression- and fitness-based genomic approaches. Our results reveal that gene expression changes and mutant fitness in response to sub-MIC antimicrobials do not correlate on a genomewide scale, indicating that gene expression is not a good predictor of fitness determinants. In general, fewer fitness determinants were identified for antiseptics and disinfectants than for antibiotics. Analysis of gene expression and fitness data together allowed the prediction of antagonistic interactions between antimicrobials and insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling these interactions.

IMPORTANCE

Infections involving multidrug-resistant pathogens are difficult to treat because the therapeutic options are limited. These infections impose a significant financial burden on infected patients and on health care systems. Despite years of antimicrobial resistance research, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms controlling antimicrobial resistance. This work uses two fine-scale genomic approaches to identify genetic loci important for antimicrobial resistance of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results reveal that antibiotics have more resistance determinants than antiseptics/disinfectants and that gene expression upon exposure to antimicrobials is not a good predictor of these resistance determinants. In addition, we show that when used together, genomewide gene expression and fitness profiling can provide mechanistic insights into multidrug resistance mechanisms.},

Viable enteric indicator or pathogenic bacteria in the biosolids were enumerated by plate count, gene targets associated with antibiotic resistance or horizontal gene transfer were detected by PCR, and a subset of these gene targets were quantified by qPCR. Following application at commercial rates to field plots, the persistence of enteric bacteria and gene targets in soil was followed during the growing season. Carrots, radishes and lettuce were sown into the amended and unamended control plots, and the diversity and abundance of gene targets they carried at harvest determined. All three Class A biosolids carried fewer and less abundant antibiotic resistance genes than did the Class B biosolids, in particular the very alkaline N-Viro product (N-Rich). Following application, some gene targets (e.g. int1, sul1, strA/B, aadA) that are typically associated with mobile gene cassettes remained detectable throughout the growing season, whereas others (e.g. ermB, ermF, blaOXA20) that are not associated with cassettes became undetectable within three weeks or less. At harvest a larger number of gene targets were detected on the carrots and radishes than in the lettuce. Overall, land application of Class A biosolids will entrain fewer viable bacteria and genes associated with antibiotic resistance into crop ground than will amendment with Class B biosolids.},

The International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP) only recognizes cultures as 'type material', thereby preventing the naming of uncultivated organisms. In this Consensus Statement, we propose two potential paths to solve this nomenclatural conundrum. One option is the adoption of previously proposed modifications to the ICNP to recognize DNA sequences as acceptable type material; the other option creates a nomenclatural code for uncultivated Archaea and Bacteria that could eventually be merged with the ICNP in the future. Regardless of the path taken, we believe that action is needed now within the scientific community to develop consistent rules for nomenclature of uncultivated taxa in order to provide clarity and stability, and to effectively communicate microbial diversity.},

 abstract = {Even though the use of antibiotics for food-producing animals may contribute to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, antibiotics are still used as growth promoters. Due to consumer and regulatory pressures, the use of alternatives to antibiotics as growth promoters is increasing, thus more information is needed on their capability to disseminate antimicrobial resistance compared to antibiotics. We investigated the impacts of carbadox (antibiotic), copper sulfate and zinc oxide (metals) and mushroom powder (natural product) on the pig fecal resistome and microbiome. Antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) and mobile genetic element (MGE) abundances were measured using a high-throughput qPCR array with 382 primer pairs. Bacterial community composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. More ARGs co-occurred with MGEs in the growth promoter group samples than in the control group samples. Community composition could not be linked to resistome in the growth promoter group samples, indicating a potential decoupling of ARGs and phylogeny. Additionally, machine-learning methods aided in defining the community and resistome differences in response to treatments. Since increased ARG mobility potential was the primary response to the dietary additives used in this study, we suggest that ARG mobility should be considered when designing antimicrobial use policies and antimicrobial resistance surveillances.},

While the aadB and the arr-2 gene cassettes were identical to those previously described, the remaining cassettes were novel: (i) a novel nonenzymatic chloramphenicol resistance gene of the cmlA family, (ii) a qac allele encoding a member of the small multidrug resistance family of proteins, (iii) a cassette, aacA1b/orfG, which encodes a novel 6'-N-acetyltransferase, and (iv) a fused gene cassette, oxa10/aadA1, which is made of two cassettes previously described as single cassettes. In addition, oxa10 and aadA1 genes were expressed from their own promoter sequence present upstream of the oxa10 cassette. arr-2 coded for a protein that shared 54{\%} amino acid identity with the rifampin ADP-ribosylating transferase encoded by the arr-1 gene from Mycobacterium smegmatis DSM43756. While in M. smegmatis, the main inactivated compound was 23-ribosyl-rifampin, the inactivated antibiotic recovered from E. coli culture was 23-O-ADP-ribosyl-rifampin. The integrase gene of In53 was interrupted by an IS26 insertion sequence, which was also present in the 3' conserved segment. Thus, In53 is a truncated integron located on a composite transposon, named Tn2000, bounded by two IS26 elements in opposite orientations. Target site duplication at both ends of the transposon indicated that the integron likely was inserted into the plasmid through a transpositional process. This is the first description of an integron located on a composite transposon.},

Venn diagrams are frequently used to compare composition of datasets (e.g. datasets containing list of proteins and genes). Network diagram constructed using such datasets are usually generated using 'list of edges', popularly known as edge-lists. An edge-list and the corresponding generated network are, however, composed of two elements, namely, edges (e.g. protein-protein interactions) and nodes (e.g. proteins). Researchers often use individual lists of edges and nodes to compare composition of biological networks using existing Venn diagram tools. However, specialized analysis workflows are required for comparison of nodes as well as edges. Apart from this, different tools or graph libraries are needed for visualizing any specific edges of interest (e.g. protein-protein interactions which are present across all networks or are shared between subset of networks or are exclusively present in a selected network). Further, these results are required to be exported in the form of publication worthy network diagram(s), particularly for small networks.

RESULTS

We introduce a (server independent) JavaScript framework (called NetSets.js) that integrates popular Venn and network diagrams in a single application. A free to use intuitive web application (utilizing NetSets.js), specifically designed to perform both compositional comparisons (e.g. for identifying common/exclusive edges or nodes) and interactive user defined visualizations of network (for the identified common/exclusive interactions across multiple networks) using simple edge-lists is also presented. The tool also enables connection to Cytoscape desktop application using the Netsets-Cyapp. We demonstrate the utility of our tool using real world biological networks (microbiome, gene interaction, multiplex and protein-protein interaction networks).

 abstract = {The administration of macrolides such as azithromycin for chronic pulmonary infection of cystic fibrosis patients has been reported to be of benefit. Although the mechanisms of action remain obscure, anti-inflammatory effects as well as interference of the macrolide with Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence factor production have been suggested to contribute to an improved clinical outcome. In this study we used a systematic approach and analyzed the impact of azithromycin on the global transcriptional pattern and the protein expression profile of P. aeruginosa PAO1 cultures versus those in untreated controls. The most remarkable result of this study is the finding that azithromycin exhibited extensive quorum-sensing antagonistic activities. In accordance with the inhibition of the quorum-sensing systems, virulence factor production was diminished and the oxidative stress response was impaired, whereas the type III secretion system was strongly induced. Moreover, P. aeruginosa motility was reduced, which probably accounts for the previously observed impaired biofilm formation capabilities of azithromycin-treated cultures. The interference of azithromycin with quorum-sensing-dependent virulence factor production, biofilm formation, and oxidative stress resistance in P. aeruginosa holds great promise for macrolide therapy in cystic fibrosis. Clearly quorum-sensing antagonist macrolides should be paid more attention in the management of chronic P. aeruginosa infections, and as quorum-sensing antagonists, macrolides might gain vital importance for more general application against chronic infections.},

Identifying differentially abundant microbes is a common goal of microbiome studies. Multiple methods have been applied for this purpose, which are largely used interchangeably in the literature. Although it has been observed that these tools can produce different results, there have been very few large-scale comparisons to describe the scale and significance of these differences. In addition, it is challenging for microbiome researchers to know which differential abundance tools are appropriate for their study and how these tools compare to one another. Here, we have investigated these questions by analyzing 38 16S rRNA gene datasets with two sample groups for differential abundance testing. We tested for differences in amplicon sequence variants and operational taxonomic units (referred to as ASVs for simplicity) between these groups with 14 commonly used differential abundance tools. Our findings confirmed that these tools identified drastically different numbers and sets of significant ASVs, however, for many tools the number of features identified correlated with aspects of the tested study data, such as sample size, sequencing depth, and effect size of community differences. We also found that the ASVs identified by each method were dependent on whether the abundance tables were prevalence-filtered before testing. ALDEx2 and ANCOM produced the most consistent results across studies and agreed best with the intersect of results from different approaches. In contrast, several methods, such as LEfSe, limma voom, and edgeR, produced inconsistent results and in some cases were unable to control the false discovery rate. In addition to these observations, we were unable to find supporting evidence for a recent recommendation that limma voom, corncob, and DESeq2 are more reliable overall compared with other methods. Although ALDEx2 and ANCOM are two promising conservative methods, we argue that those researchers requiring more sensitive methods should use a consensus approach based on multiple differential abundance methods to help ensure robust biological interpretations.},

To our knowledge, culture-independent approaches and molecular biology tools such as biomass quantification and biodiversity analyses have never been applied to swine building bioaerosol analyses. Total DNA of each sample was extracted and analysed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and phylogenetic analysis using primers targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Even though the total bacterial concentration was higher in winter than in summer, the total bacterial concentration for both seasons was 100 to1000 times higher than the total cultural bacteria. The concentration of bioaerosol was influenced by the temperature indoors, which was regulated with an electronic fan system driving warm air and particles outside of the SCB. Comparison of the DGGE profiles showed the same biodiversity in each SCB during both seasons. The phylogenetic analysis revealed a large number of sequences (93.8{\%}) related to Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, such as Clostridia, and dominated by the Clostridia cluster I (C. disporicum) and the Clostridia cluster XI (C. glycolycum). The bioaerosol diversity also contained also a low proportion of Bacteroidetes and Lactobacillales-Streptococcales sequences. Analyses of the global community and phylotype diversity showed that the main source of bioaerosols could come from the pig manure slurry.},

Biodegradation by genetically adapted bacteria has been suggested to perform a major contribution to the removal of pesticides in BPSs. Recently, several studies pointed to the role of IncP-1 plasmids in the degradation of pesticides in BPSs but this was never linked with catabolic markers. Therefore, a microcosm experiment was conducted in order to examine whether changes in mobile genetic element (MGE) abundances in response to the application of phenylurea herbicide linuron are linked with changes in catabolic genes. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprints of 16S ribosomal RNA gene fragments amplified from total community (TC)-DNA suggested significant shifts in the bacterial community composition. PCR-Southern blot-based detection of genes involved in linuron hydrolysis (libA and hylA) or degradation of its metabolite 3,4-dichloroaniline (dcaQ I , dcaQ II , and ccdC) in TC-DNA showed that the abundance of the hylA gene was increased faster and stronger in response to linuron application than that of the libA gene, and that the dcaQ II gene was more abundant than the isofunctional gene dcaQ I 20 and 60~days after linuron addition. Furthermore, a significant increase in the relative abundance of the IncP-1-specific korB gene in response to linuron was recorded. Our data suggest that different bacterial populations bearing isofunctional genes coding for enzymes degrading linuron seemed to be enriched in BPSs in response to linuron and that IncP-1 plasmids might be involved in their dissemination.},

However, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) collect chemicals, organic matter, and microorganisms including pathogens and multi-resistant bacteria from various sources which may be potentially released into the environment via WWTP effluent. To better understand microbial dynamics in WWTPs, we characterized and compared the bacterial community of the inflow and effluent of a WWTP in Berlin, Germany using full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences, which allowed for species level determination in many cases and generally resolved bacterial taxa. Significantly distinct bacterial communities were identified in the wastewater inflow and effluent samples. Dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) varied both temporally and spatially. Disease associated bacterial groups were efficiently reduced in their relative abundance from the effluent by the WWTP treatment process, except for Legionella and Leptospira species which demonstrated an increase in relative proportion from inflow to effluent. This indicates that WWTPs, while effective against enteric bacteria, may enrich and release other potentially pathogenic bacteria into the environment. The taxonomic resolution of full-length 16S rRNA genes allows for improved characterization of potential pathogenic taxa and other harmful bacteria which is required to reliably assess health risk.},

Sewage sludge (SS) is derived from the wastewater treatment plants, considered important underused biomass, and can be used as a biofertilizer when properly stabilized due to the high content of inorganic matter, nitrate, and phosphorus. However, a wide range of pollutants can be present in these biosolids, limiting or prohibiting their use as biofertilizer, depending on the type and origin of industrial waste and household products. Long-term applications of these biosolids could substantially increase the concentration of contaminants, causing detrimental effects on the environment and induce hyperaccumulation or phytotoxicity in the produced crops. In this work, some critical parameters for soils and SS agronomic use, such as organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium (NPK), and heavy metals concentration have been reviewed. Several cases of food crop production and the accumulation of heavy metals after SS application are also discussed. SS production, usage, and legislation in EU are assessed to determine the possibility of sustainable management of this bioresource. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) guidelines are addressed. The opportunity to produce bioenergy crops, employing sewage sludge to enhance degraded land, is also considered, due to energy security. Although there are numerous advantages of sewage sludge, proper screening for heavy metals in all the variants (biosolids, soil, food products) is a must. SS application requires appropriate strict guidelines with appropriate regulatory oversight to control contamination of agricultural soils.},

 abstract = {The spread of antibiotic resistance is a growing public health concern. While numerous studies have highlighted the importance of environmental sources and pathways of the spread of antibiotic resistance, a systematic means of comparing and prioritizing risks represented by various environmental compartments is lacking. Here, we introduce MetaCompare, a publicly available tool for ranking 'resistome risk', which we define as the potential for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to be associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and mobilize to pathogens based on metagenomic data. A computational pipeline was developed in which each ARG is evaluated based on relative abundance, mobility, and presence within a pathogen. This is determined through the assembly of shotgun sequencing data and analysis of contigs containing ARGs to determine if they contain sequence similarity to MGEs or human pathogens. Based on the assembled metagenomes, samples are projected into a 3-dimensionalhazard space and assigned resistome risk scores. To validate, we tested previously published metagenomic data derived from distinct aquatic environments. Based on unsupervised machine learning, the test samples clustered in the hazard space in a manner consistent with their origin. The derived scores produced a well-resolved ascending resistome risk ranking of: wastewater treatment plant effluent, dairy lagoon, and hospital sewage.},

 abstract = {Motivation

Antibiotic resistance is an important global public health problem. Human gut microbiota is an accumulator of resistance genes potentially providing them to pathogens. It is important to develop tools for identifying the mechanisms of how resistance is transmitted between gut microbial species and pathogens.

Results

We developed MetaCherchant-an algorithm for extracting the genomic environment of antibiotic resistance genes from metagenomic data in the form of a graph. The algorithm was validated on a number of simulated and published datasets, as well as applied to new 'shotgun' metagenomes of gut microbiota from patients with Helicobacter pylori who underwent antibiotic therapy. Genomic context was reconstructed for several major resistance genes. Taxonomic annotation of the context suggests that within a single metagenome, the resistance genes can be contained in genomes of multiple species. MetaCherchant allows reconstruction of mobile elements with resistance genes within the genomes of bacteria using metagenomic data. Application of MetaCherchant in differential mode produced specific graph structures suggesting the evidence of possible resistance gene transmission within a mobile element that occurred as a result of the antibiotic therapy. MetaCherchant is a promising tool giving researchers an opportunity to get an insight into dynamics of resistance transmission in vivo basing on metagenomic data.

Although insightful, such studies have a largely ad hoc nature and would benefit from a systematic strategy enabling a joint functional characterization of bacterial methylomes by the microbiology community. In this opinion article, we propose that highly conserved DNA methyltransferases (MTases) represent a unique opportunity for bacterial epigenomic studies. These MTases are rather common in bacteria, span various taxonomic scales, and are present in multiple human pathogens. Apart from well-characterized core DNA MTases, like those from Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella enterica, Clostridioides difficile, or Streptococcus pyogenes, multiple highly conserved DNA MTases are also found in numerous human pathogens, including those belonging to the genera Burkholderia and Acinetobacter. We discuss why and how these MTases can be prioritized to enable a community-wide, integrative approach for functional epigenomic studies. Ultimately, we discuss how some highly conserved DNA MTases may emerge as promising targets for the development of novel epigenetic inhibitors for biomedical applications.},

However, the diversity of gene cassettes and the abundance of class 1 integrons outside of the clinical context are not fully explored. Primers targeting the conserved segments of attC recombination sites were used to amplify gene cassettes from the sediment of the Mina stream, which exhibited a higher degree of stress to metal pollution in the dry season than the rainy season. Of the 143 total analyzed sequences, 101 had no matches to proteins in the database, where cassette open reading frames could be identified by homology with database entries. There was a predominance of sequences encoding essential cellular functions. Each season that was sampled yielded a specific pool of gene cassettes. Real-time PCR revealed that 8.5 and 41.6~{\%} of bacterial cells potentially harbored a class 1 integron in the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. In summary, our findings demonstrate that most of the gene cassettes have no ascribable function and, apparently, historically metal-contaminated sediment favors the maintenance of bacteria containing the intI1 gene. Thus, the diversity of gene cassettes is far from being fully explored deserving further attention.},

The diverse environmental factors which induce this state, and the variety of bacteria which have been shown to enter into the VBNC state, are listed.

The ability of cells to resuscitate from the VBNC state and return to an actively metabolizing and culturable form is described, as well as the ability of these cells to retain virulence. Finally, the question of why cells become nonculturable is addressed. It is hoped that this mini-review will encourage researchers to consider this survival state in their studies as an alternative to the conclusion that a lack of culturability indicates the cells they are examining are dead.},

Importantly, these infections are often difficult to treat effectively in part due to the recalcitrance of biofilms to antimicrobial therapy. Emerging evidence suggests that polymicrobial interactions can lead to dramatic and unexpected changes in the ability of antibiotics to eradicate biofilms and often result in decreased antimicrobial efficacy in vitro In this review, we discuss the influence of polymicrobial interactions on the antibiotic susceptibility of biofilms, and we highlight the studies that first documented the shifted antimicrobial susceptibilities of mixed-species cultures. Recent studies have identified several mechanisms underlying the recalcitrance of polymicrobial biofilm communities, including interspecies exchange of antibiotic resistance genes, \textgreek{b}-lactamase-mediated inactivation of antibiotics, changes in gene expression induced by metabolites and quorum sensing signals, inhibition of the electron transport chain, and changes in properties of the cell membrane. In addition to elucidating multiple mechanisms that contribute to the altered drug susceptibility of polymicrobial biofilms, these studies have uncovered novel ways in which polymicrobial interactions can impact microbial physiology. The diversity of findings discussed highlights the importance of continuing to investigate the efficacy of antibiotics against biofilm communities composed of different combinations of microbial species. Together, the data presented here illustrate the importance of studying microbes as part of mixed-species communities rather than in isolation. In light of our greater understanding of how interspecies interactions alter the efficacy of antimicrobial agents, we propose that the methods for measuring the drug susceptibility of polymicrobial infections should be revisited.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Antibacterial biocides and metals can co-select for antibiotic resistance when bacteria harbour resistance or tolerance genes towards both types of compounds. Despite numerous case studies, systematic and quantitative data on co-occurrence of such genes on plasmids and chromosomes is lacking, as is knowledge on environments and bacterial taxa that tend to carry resistance genes to such compounds. This effectively prevents identification of risk scenarios. Therefore, we aimed to identify general patterns for which biocide/metal resistance genes (BMRGs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that tend to occur together. We also aimed to quantify co-occurrence of resistance genes in different environments and taxa, and investigate to what extent plasmids carrying both types of genes are conjugative and/or are carrying toxin-antitoxin systems.

RESULTS

Co-occurrence patterns of resistance genes were derived from publicly available, fully sequenced bacterial genomes (n = 2522) and plasmids (n = 4582). The only BMRGs commonly co-occurring with ARGs on plasmids were mercury resistance genes and the qacE∆1 gene that provides low-level resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds. Novel connections between cadmium/zinc and macrolide/aminoglycoside resistance genes were also uncovered. Several clinically important bacterial taxa were particularly prone to carry both BMRGs and ARGs. Bacteria carrying BMRGs more often carried ARGs compared to bacteria without (p {\textless} 0.0001). BMRGs were found in 86 {\%} of bacterial genomes, and co-occurred with ARGs in 17 {\%} of the cases. In contrast, co-occurrences of BMRGs and ARGs were rare on plasmids from all external environments ({\textless}0.7 {\%}) but more common on those of human and domestic animal origin (5 {\%} and 7 {\%}, respectively). Finally, plasmids with both BMRGs and ARGs were more likely to be conjugative (p {\textless} 0.0001) and carry toxin-antitoxin systems (p {\textless} 0.0001) than plasmids without resistance genes.

CONCLUSIONS

This is the first large-scale identification of compounds, taxa and environments of particular concern for co-selection of resistance against antibiotics, biocides and metals. Genetic co-occurrences suggest that plasmids provide limited opportunities for biocides and metals to promote horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance through co-selection, whereas ample possibilities exist for indirect selection via chromosomal BMRGs. Taken together, the derived patterns improve our understanding of co-selection potential between biocides, metals and antibiotics, and thereby provide guidance for risk-reducing actions.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are widespread but cause problems only when present in pathogens. Environments where selection and transmission of antibiotic resistance frequently take place are likely to be characterized by high abundance and diversity of horizontally transferable ARGs. Large-scale quantitative data on ARGs is, however, lacking for most types of environments, including humans and animals, as is data on resistance genes to potential co-selective agents, such as biocides and metals. This paucity prevents efficient identification of risk environments.

RESULTS

We provide a comprehensive characterization of resistance genes, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and bacterial taxonomic compositions for 864 metagenomes from humans (n = 350), animals (n = 145) and external environments (n = 369), all deeply sequenced using Illumina technology. Environment types showed clear differences in both resistance profiles and bacterial community compositions. Human and animal microbial communities were characterized by limited taxonomic diversity and low abundance and diversity of biocide/metal resistance genes and MGEs but a relatively high abundance of ARGs. In contrast, external environments showed consistently high taxonomic diversity which in turn was linked to high diversity of both biocide/metal resistance genes and MGEs. Water, sediment and soil generally carried low relative abundance and few varieties of known ARGs, whereas wastewater/sludge was on par with the human gut. The environments with the largest relative abundance and/or diversity of ARGs, including genes encoding resistance to last resort antibiotics, were those subjected to industrial antibiotic pollution and a limited set of deeply sequenced air samples from a Beijing smog event.

CONCLUSIONS

Our study identifies air and antibiotic-polluted environments as under-investigated transmission routes and reservoirs for antibiotic resistance. The high taxonomic and genetic diversity of external environments supports the hypothesis that these also form vast sources of unknown resistance genes, with potential to be transferred to pathogens in the future.},

 abstract = {Antibiotics are bioactive substances, and their use as human and animal medicines for illness prevention, disease treatment and growth promotion has increased in recent decades. They are excreted, either unchanged or metabolized, and are discharged to the environment through animal manure, municipal wastewater or biosolids. Consequently, these chemicals reach cropland, which is advocated as a means of recycling. As these drugs are used in escalating quantities, there is growing concern over their presence, toxicity and fate in the soil, which may pose adverse effects on plant growth and productivity, as well as result in their uptake and accumulation in crops. These will contaminate the food chain and eventually affect human health. In this review, we summarize recent research and provide a detailed overview of antibiotics in soil-plant systems, including 1) the occurrence and determination of antibiotics around the world and their routes of entry to the environment, 2) the impact of wastewater irrigation and animal manure or biosolids amendment on agricultural soils, 3) the transport and persistence of antibiotics in the terrestrial environment, and 4) the bioaccumulation and translocation of antibiotics in different tissues of edible crops under laboratory and field conditions. Their impacts on the environment and potential human exposure are elucidated. Knowledge gaps and future research perspectives are discussed.},

The distinction is more arbitrary when agents are categorized in clinical situations. The supposed superiority of bactericidal agents over bacteriostatic agents is of little relevance when treating the vast majority of infections with gram-positive bacteria, particularly in patients with uncomplicated infections and noncompromised immune systems. Bacteriostatic agents (e.g., chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and linezolid) have been effectively used for treatment of endocarditis, meningitis, and osteomyelitis--indications that are often considered to require bactericidal activity. Although bacteriostatic/bactericidal data may provide valuable information on the potential action of antibacterial agents in vitro, it is necessary to combine this information with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data to provide more meaningful prediction of efficacy in vivo. The ultimate guide to treatment of any infection must be clinical outcome.},

 abstract = {MOTIVATION

Metagenomics is the study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples. Taxonomic and functional differences between metagenomic samples can highlight the influence of ecological factors on patterns of microbial life in a wide range of habitats. Statistical hypothesis tests can help us distinguish ecological influences from sampling artifacts, but knowledge of only the P-value from a statistical hypothesis test is insufficient to make inferences about biological relevance. Current reporting practices for pairwise comparative metagenomics are inadequate, and better tools are needed for comparative metagenomic analysis.

RESULTS

We have developed a new software package, STAMP, for comparative metagenomics that supports best practices in analysis and reporting. Examination of a pair of iron mine metagenomes demonstrates that deeper biological insights can be gained using statistical techniques available in our software. An analysis of the functional potential of 'Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis' in two enhanced biological phosphorus removal metagenomes identified several subsystems that differ between the A.phosphatis stains in these related communities, including phosphate metabolism, secretion and metal transport.

Development of a robust bacterial taxonomy has been hindered by an inability to obtain most bacteria in pure culture and, to a lesser extent, by the historical use of phenotypes to guide classification. Culture-independent sequencing technologies have matured sufficiently that a comprehensive genome-based taxonomy is now possible. We used a concatenated protein phylogeny as the basis for a bacterial taxonomy that conservatively removes polyphyletic groups and normalizes taxonomic ranks on the basis of relative evolutionary divergence. Under this approach, 58{\%} of the 94,759 genomes comprising the Genome Taxonomy Database had changes to their existing taxonomy. This result includes the description of 99 phyla, including six major monophyletic units from the subdivision of the Proteobacteria, and amalgamation of the Candidate Phyla Radiation into a single phylum. Our taxonomy should enable improved classification of uncultured bacteria and provide a sound basis for ecological and evolutionary studies.},

We developed a new cost and labor efficient method based on Inverse PCR and long read sequencing for studying mobility potential of environmental resistance genes. We applied Inverse PCR on sediment samples and identified 79 different MGE clusters associated with the studied resistance genes, including novel mobile genetic elements, co-selected resistance genes and a new putative antibiotic resistance gene.

We find that fecal ARG and mobile genetic element (MGE) profiles of infants are more similar to those of their own mothers than to those of unrelated mothers. MGEs in mothers' breast milk are also shared with their own infants. Termination of breastfeeding and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis of mothers, which have the potential to affect microbial community composition, are associated with higher abundances of specific ARGs, the composition of which is largely shaped by bacterial phylogeny in the infant gut.

Using highly parallel quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we analyzed 229 resistance genes and 25 mobile genetic elements. This first trans-Europe surveillance showed that UWTP AR profiles mirror the AR gradient observed in clinics. Antibiotic use, environmental temperature, and UWTP size were important factors related with resistance persistence and spread in the environment.

An updated compilation of gene cassettes found in sequences of such 'mobile resistance integrons' in GenBank was facilitated by a specially developed automated annotation system. At least 130 different ({\textless}98{\%} identical) cassettes that carry known or predicted antibiotic resistance genes were identified, along with many cassettes of unknown function. We list exemplar GenBank accession numbers for each and address some nomenclature issues.

 abstract = {Strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics, particularly those that are multiresistant, are an increasing major health care problem around the world. It is now abundantly clear that both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are able to meet the evolutionary challenge of combating antimicrobial chemotherapy, often by acquiring preexisting resistance determinants from the bacterial gene pool. This is achieved through the concerted activities of mobile genetic elements able to move within or between DNA molecules, which include insertion sequences, transposons, and gene cassettes/integrons, and those that are able to transfer between bacterial cells, such as plasmids and integrative conjugative elements. Together these elements play a central role in facilitating horizontal genetic exchange and therefore promote the acquisition and spread of resistance genes. This review aims to outline the characteristics of the major types of mobile genetic elements involved in acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, focusing on the so-called ESKAPEE group of organisms (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli), which have become the most problematic hospital pathogens.},

 abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems serve as a dissemination pathway and a reservoir of both antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). In this study, we investigate the role of the bacterial sporobiota to act as a vector for ARG dispersal in aquatic ecosystems. The sporobiota was operationally defined as the resilient fraction of the bacterial community withstanding a harsh extraction treatment eliminating the easily lysed fraction of the total bacterial community. The sporobiota has been identified as a critical component of the human microbiome, and therefore potentially a key element in the dissemination of ARG in human-impacted environments. A region of Lake Geneva in which the accumulation of ARG in the sediments has been previously linked to the deposition of treated wastewater was selected to investigate the dissemination of tet(W) and sul1, two genes conferring resistance to tetracycline and sulfonamide, respectively. Analysis of the abundance of these ARG within the sporobiome (collection of genes of the sporobiota) and correlation with community composition and environmental parameters demonstrated that ARG can spread across the environment with the sporobiota being the dispersal vector. A highly abundant OTU affiliated with the genus Clostridium was identified as a potential specific vector for the dissemination of tet(W), due to a strong correlation with tet(W) frequency (ARG copy numbers/ng DNA). The high dispersal rate, long-term survival, and potential reactivation of the sporobiota constitute a serious concern in terms of dissemination and persistence of ARG in the environment.},

 abstract = {The intensive use of antibiotics for human, veterinary and agricultural purposes, results in their continuous release into the environment. Together with antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are introduced into wastewater. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are believed to be probable hotspots for antibiotic resistance dissemination in the environment as they offer convenient conditions for ARB proliferation as well as for horizontal transfer of ARGs among different microorganisms. In fact, genes conferring resistance to all classes of antibiotics together with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) like plasmids, transposons, bacteriophages, integrons are detected in WWTPs in different countries. It seems that WWTPs with conventional treatment processes are capable of significant reduction of ARB but are not efficient in ARG removal. Implementation of advanced wastewater cleaning processes in addition to a conventional wastewater treatment is an important step to protect the aquatic environment. Growing interest in presence and fate of ARB and ARGs in WWTP systems resulted in the fact that knowledge in this area has increased staggeringly in the past few years. The main aim of the article is to collect and organize available data on ARGs, that are commonly detected in raw sewage, treated wastewater or activated sludge. Resistance to the antibiotics usually used in antibacterial therapy belonging to main classes like beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, sulfonamides, trimethoprim and tetracyclines was taken into account. The presence of multidrug efflux genes is also included in this paper. The occurrence of antibiotics may promote the selection of ARB and ARGs. As it is important to discuss the problem considering all aspects that influence it, the levels of antibiotics detected in influent and effluent of WWTPs were also presented.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Metagenomic sequencing has led to the identification and assembly of many new bacterial genome sequences. These bacteria often contain plasmids: usually small, circular double-stranded DNA molecules that may transfer across bacterial species and confer antibiotic resistance. These plasmids are generally less studied and understood than their bacterial hosts. Part of the reason for this is insufficient computational tools enabling the analysis of plasmids in metagenomic samples.

RESULTS

We developed SCAPP (Sequence Contents-Aware Plasmid Peeler)-an algorithm and tool to assemble plasmid sequences from metagenomic sequencing. SCAPP builds on some key ideas from the Recycler algorithm while improving plasmid assemblies by integrating biological knowledge about plasmids. We compared the performance of SCAPP to Recycler and metaplasmidSPAdes on simulated metagenomes, real human gut microbiome samples, and a human gut plasmidome dataset that we generated. We also created plasmidome and metagenome data from the same cow rumen sample and used the parallel sequencing data to create a novel assessment procedure. Overall, SCAPP outperformed Recycler and metaplasmidSPAdes across this wide range of datasets.

CONCLUSIONS

SCAPP is an easy to use Python package that enables the assembly of full plasmid sequences from metagenomic samples. It outperformed existing metagenomic plasmid assemblers in most cases and assembled novel and clinically relevant plasmids in samples we generated such as a human gut plasmidome. SCAPP is open-source software available from: https://github.com/Shamir-Lab/SCAPP . Video abstract.},

 abstract = {Recently, there has been increased concern about the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistant genes (ARG), in treated domestic wastewaters, animal manures and municipal biosolids. The concern is whether these additional sources of ARB contribute to antibiotic resistance levels in the environment, that is, {\textquotedbl}environmental antibiotic resistance.{\textquotedbl} ARB and ARG occur naturally in soil and water, and it remains unclear whether the introduction of ARB in liquid and solid municipal and animal wastes via land application have any significant impact on the background levels of antibiotic resistance in the environment, and whether they affect human exposure to ARB. In this current review, we examine and re-evaluate the incidence of ARB and ARG resulting from land application activities, and offer a new perspective on the threat of antibiotic resistance to public health via exposure from nonclinical environmental sources. Based on inputs of ARBs and ARGs from land application, their fate in soil due to soil microbial ecology principles, and background indigenous levels of ARBs and ARGs already present in soil, we conclude that while antibiotic resistance levels in soil are increased temporally by land application of wastes, their persistence is not guaranteed and is in fact variable, and often contradictory based on application site. Furthermore, the application of wastes may not produce the most direct impact of ARGs and ARB on public health. Further investigation is still warranted in agriculture and public health, including continued scrutiny of antibiotic use in both sectors.},

 abstract = {Integrons are genetic elements that facilitate the horizontal gene transfer in bacteria and are known to harbor genes associated with antibiotic resistance. The gene mobility in the integrons is governed by the presence of attC sites, which are 55 to 141-nucleotide-long imperfect inverted repeats. Here we present HattCI, a new method for fast and accurate identification of attC sites in large DNA data sets. The method is based on a generalized hidden Markov model that describes each core component of an attC site individually. Using twofold cross-validation experiments on a manually curated reference data set of 231 attC sites from class 1 and 2 integrons, HattCI showed high sensitivities of up to 91.9{\%} while maintaining satisfactory false-positive rates. When applied to a metagenomic data set of 35 microbial communities from different environments, HattCI found a substantially higher number of attC sites in the samples that are known to contain more horizontally transferred elements. HattCI will significantly increase the ability to identify attC sites and thus integron-mediated genes in genomic and metagenomic data. HattCI is implemented in C and is freely available at http://bioinformatics.math.chalmers.se/HattCI .},

 abstract = {Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes community-acquired respiratory tract infections, particularly in school-aged children and young adults. These infections occur both endemically and epidemically worldwide. M. pneumoniae lacks cell wall and is subsequently resistant to beta-lactams and to all antimicrobials targeting the cell wall. This mycoplasma is intrinsically susceptible to macrolides and related antibiotics, to tetracyclines and to fluoroquinolones. Macrolides and related antibiotics are the first-line treatment of M. pneumoniae respiratory tract infections mainly because of their low MIC against the bacteria, their low toxicity and the absence of contraindication in young children. The newer macrolides are now the preferred agents with a 7-to-14 day course of oral clarithromycin or a 5-day course of oral azithromycin for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia due to M. pneumoniae, according to the different guidelines worldwide. However, macrolide resistance has been spreading for 15 years worldwide, with prevalence now ranging between 0 and 15{\%} in Europe and the USA, approximately 30{\%} in Israel and up to 90-100{\%} in Asia. This resistance is associated with point mutations in the peptidyl-transferase loop of the 23S rRNA and leads to high-level resistance to macrolides. Macrolide resistance-associated mutations can be detected using several molecular methods applicable directly from respiratory specimens. Because this resistance has clinical outcomes such as longer duration of fever, cough and hospital stay, alternative antibiotic treatment can be required, including tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline or fluoroquinolones, primarily levofloxacin, during 7-14 days, even though fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines are contraindicated in all children and in children {\textless} 8 year-old, respectively. Acquired resistance to tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones has never been reported in M. pneumoniae clinical isolates but reduced susceptibility was reported in in vitro selected mutants. This article focuses on M. pneumoniae antibiotic susceptibility and on the development and the evolution of acquired resistance. Molecular detection of resistant mutants and therapeutic options in case of macrolide resistance will also be assessed.},

We investigated the mechanisms of ARG dissemination and persistence to disentangle i) the influence of nutrients and microorganisms on the soil tetracycline (TET) resistome, and ii) the role of indigenous soil microbiota in preventing ARG spread. We analysed short-term (7 days) and persistent (84 days) effects of manure on the resistome of three antibiotic-free pasture soils. Four microcosm treatments were evaluated: control, mineral nutrient fertilization, and deposition of a layer of fresh manure onto soil or \textgreek{g}-irradiated soil. We quantified five TET-resistance genes, isolated 135 TET-resistant bacteria and sequenced both culturable TET-resistant and whole bacterial communities. Manure amendments, but not nutrient addition, increased the abundance of TET-r genes such as tet(Y). Such changes persisted with time, in contrast with the TET-resistant bacterial composition, which partially recovered after manure amendments. Manured \textgreek{g}-irradiated soils showed significantly lower nutrient content and higher TET-r gene abundance than non-irradiated soils, suggesting that native soil bacteria are essential for the fertilization effect of manure on soil as well as control the dissemination of potentially risky TET-r genes.},

 abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is an ancient problem, owing to the co-evolution of antibiotic-producing and target organisms in the soil and other environments over millennia. The environmental {\textquotedbl}resistome{\textquotedbl} is the collection of all genes that directly or indirectly contribute to antibiotic resistance. Many of these resistance determinants originate in antibiotic-producing organisms (where they serve to mediate self-immunity), while others become resistance determinants only when mobilized and over-expressed in non-native hosts (like plasmid-encoded \textgreek{b}-lactamases). The modern environmental resistome is under selective pressure from human activities such as agriculture, which may influence the composition of the local resistome and lead to gene transfer events. Beyond the environment, we are challenged in the clinic by the rise in both frequency and diversity of antibiotic resistant pathogens. We assume that clinical resistance originated in the environment, but few examples of direct gene exchange between the environmental resistome and the clinical resistome have been documented. Strong evidence exists to suggest that clinical aminoglycoside and vancomycin resistance enzymes, the extended-spectrum \textgreek{b}-lactamase CTX-M and the quinolone resistance gene qnr have direct links to the environmental resistome. In this review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes from the environment to the clinic. Improvements in sequencing technologies coupled with functional metagenomic studies have revealed previously underappreciated diversity in the environmental resistome, and also established novel genetic links to the clinic. Understanding mechanisms of gene exchange becomes vital in controlling the future dissemination of antibiotic resistance.},

 abstract = {Azithromycin is an acid stable orally administered macrolide antimicrobial drug, structurally related to erythromycin, with a similar spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Azithromycin is marginally less active than erythromycin in vitro against Gram-positive organisms, although this is of doubtful clinical significance as susceptibility concentrations fall within the range of achievable tissue azithromycin concentrations. In contrast, azithromycin appears to be more active than erythromycin against many Gram-negative pathogens and several other pathogens, notably Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Urea-plasma urealyticum and Borrelia burgdorferi. Like erythromycin and other macrolides, the activity of azithromycin is unaffected by the production of beta-lactamase. However, erythromycin-resistant organisms are also resistant to azithromycin. Following oral administration, serum concentrations of azithromycin are lower than those of erythromycin, but this reflects the rapid and extensive movement of the drug from the circulation into intracellular compartments resulting in tissue concentrations exceeding those commonly seen with erythromycin. Azithromycin is subsequently slowly released, reflecting its long terminal phase elimination half-life relative to that of erythromycin. These factors allow for a single dose or single daily dose regimen in most infections, with the potential for increased compliance among outpatients where a more frequent antimicrobial regimen might traditionally be indicated. The potential disadvantage of low azithromycin serum concentrations, however, is that breakthrough bacteraemia may occur in patients who are severely ill; nevertheless, animal studies suggest that tissue concentrations of azithromycin are more important than those in serum when treating respiratory and other infections. The clinical efficacy of azithromycin has been confirmed in the treatment of infections of the lower and upper respiratory tracts (the latter including paediatric patients), skin and soft tissues (again including paediatric patients), in uncomplicated urethritis/cervicitis associated with N. gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis or U. urealyticum and in the treatment of early Lyme disease. Azithromycin was as effective as erythromycin and other commonly used drugs including clarithromycin, beta-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporins), and quinolone and tetracycline antibiotics in some of the above infections. Some patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to H. influenzae may be refractory to therapy with azithromycin (as is the case with erythromycin) indicating the need for physician vigilance, although it should be noted that azithromycin is of equivalent efficacy to amoxicillin in the treatment of such patients. In the therapy of urethritis/cervicitis associated with C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoea or U. urealyticum, a single dose azithromycin regimen offers a distinct advantage over currently available pharmacological options, while providing effective therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Here, we present the complete sequence of pKLH80 and analysis of its backbone genetic structure, including previously unknown features of the plasmid's accessory region, notably a novel variant of the \textgreek{b}-lactamase gene blaRTG-6. Plasmid pKLH80 was found to be a circular 14 835 bp molecule that has an overall G+C content of 40.3 mol{\%} and encodes 20 putative ORFs. There are two distinctive functional modules within the plasmid backbone sequence: (i) the replication module consisting of repB and the oriV region; and (ii) the mobilization module consisting of mobA, mobC and oriT. All of the aforementioned genes share sequence identities with corresponding genes of different species of Psychrobacter. The plasmid accessory region contains antibiotic resistance genes and IS elements (ISPsma1 of the IS982 family, and ISPpy1 and ISAba14 of the IS3 family) found in environmental and clinical bacterial strains of different taxa. We revealed that the sequences flanking blaRTG-6 and closely related genes from clinical bacteria are nearly identical. This fact suggests that blaRTG-6 from the environmental strain of Psychrobacter is a progenitor of blaRTG genes of clinical bacteria. We also showed that pKLH80 can replicate in different strains of Acinetobacter and Psychrobacter genera. The roles of IS elements in the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes are examined and discussed.},

Microorganisms are crucial players underpinning ecosystem functions, and the recovery of microbial communities from disturbances is therefore a key part of the complex processes determining the fate of ecosystem functioning. However, despite global environmental change consisting of numerous pressures, it is unclear and controversial how multiple disturbances affect microbial community stability and what consequences this has for ecosystem functions. This is particularly the case for those multiple or compounded disturbances that occur more frequently than the normal recovery time. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the mechanisms that can govern the responses of microbes to multiple disturbances across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We first summarize and discuss properties and mechanisms that influence resilience in aquatic and soil biomes to determine whether there are generally applicable principles. Following, we focus on interactions resulting from inherent characteristics of compounded disturbances, such as the nature of the disturbance, timing, and chronology that can lead to complex and nonadditive effects that are modulating the response of microorganisms.},

 abstract = {Bacteria can withstand killing by bactericidal antibiotics through phenotypic changes mediated by their preexisting genetic repertoire. These changes can be exhibited transiently by a large fraction of the bacterial population, giving rise to tolerance, or displayed by a small subpopulation, giving rise to persistence. Apart from undermining the use of antibiotics, tolerant and persistent bacteria foster the emergence of antibiotic-resistant mutants. Persister formation has been attributed to alterations in the abundance of particular proteins, metabolites, and signaling molecules, including toxin-antitoxin modules, adenosine triphosphate, and guanosine (penta) tetraphosphate, respectively. Here, we report that persistent bacteria form as a result of slow growth alone, despite opposite changes in the abundance of such proteins, metabolites, and signaling molecules. Our findings argue that transitory disturbances to core activities, which are often linked to cell growth, promote a persister state regardless of the underlying physiological process responsible for the change in growth.},

 abstract = {The plasmids of the incompatibility (Inc) group IncP-1, also called IncP, as extrachromosomal genetic elements can transfer and replicate virtually in all Gram-negative bacteria. They are composed of backbone genes that encode a variety of essential functions and accessory genes that have implications for human health and environmental bioremediation. Broad-host-range IncP plasmids are known to spread genes between distinct phylogenetic groups of bacteria. These genes often code for resistances to a broad spectrum of antibiotics, heavy metals, and quaternary ammonium compounds used as disinfectants. The backbone of these plasmids carries modules that enable them to effectively replicate, move to a new host via conjugative transfer and to be stably maintained in bacterial cells. The adaptive, resistance, and virulence genes are mainly located on mobile genetic elements integrated between the functional plasmid backbone modules. Environmental studies have demonstrated the wide distribution of IncP-like replicons in manure, soils and wastewater treatment plants. They also are present in strains of pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria, which can be a cause for concern, because they may encode multiresistance. Their broad distribution suggests that IncP plasmids play a crucial role in bacterial adaptation by utilizing horizontal gene transfer. This review summarizes the variety of genetic information and physiological functions carried by IncP plasmids, which can contribute to the spread of antibiotic and heavy metal resistance while also mediating the process of bioremediation of pollutants. Due to the location of the resistance genes on plasmids with a broad-host-range and the presence of transposons carrying these genes it seems that the spread of these genes would be possible and quite hazardous in infection control. Future studies are required to determine the level of risk of the spread of resistance genes located on these plasmids.},

Yet, little is known about the interactions between the two, which may impact the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Here, we develop a multiplexed barcoded approach to assess the fitness of 144 mutant-ARG combinations in Escherichia coli subjected to eight different antibiotics at 11 different concentrations. While most interactions are neutral, we identify significant interactions for 12{\%} of the mutant-ARG combinations. The ability of most ARGs to confer high-level resistance at a low fitness cost shields the selective dynamics of mutants at low drug concentrations. Therefore, high-fitness mutants are often selected regardless of their resistance level. Finally, we identify strong negative epistasis between two unrelated resistance mechanisms: the tetA tetracycline resistance gene and loss-of-function nuo mutations involved in aminoglycoside tolerance. Our study highlights important constraints that may allow better prediction and control of antibiotic resistance evolution.},

Products for in-feed medication with these compounds in combination with other antimicrobials are commonly used in Europe. Most recently approved injectable macrolides have very long elimination half-lives in both pigs and cattle, which allows once-only dosing regimens. Both in-feed medication and use of long-acting injections result in low concentrations of the active substance for prolonged periods, which causes concerns related to development of antimicrobial resistance. Acquired resistance to macrolides and lincosamides among food animal pathogens, including some zoonotic bacteria, has now emerged. A comparison of studies on the prevalence of resistance is difficult, since for many micro-organisms no agreed standards for susceptibility testing are available. With animal pathogens, the most dramatic increase in resistance has been seen in the genus Brachyspira. Resistance towards macrolides and lincosamides has also been detected in staphylococci isolated from pigs and streptococci from cattle. This article reviews the use of macrolides and lincosamides in cattle and pigs, as well as the development of resistance in target and some zoonotic pathogens.

Eroded plots had lower microbial network complexity, fewer microbial taxa, and fewer associations among microbial taxa, relative to non-eroded plots. Soil erosion also shifted microbial community composition, with decreased relative abundances of dominant phyla such as Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Gemmatimonadetes. In contrast, erosion led to an increase in the relative abundances of some bacterial families involved in N cycling, such as Acetobacteraceae and Beijerinckiaceae. Changes in microbiota characteristics were strongly related with erosion-induced changes in soil multifunctionality.

Background

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has made it possible to determine the sequence and relative abundance of all nucleotides in a biological or environmental sample. A cornerstone of NGS is the quantification of RNA or DNA presence as counts. However, these counts are not counts per se: their magnitude is determined arbitrarily by the sequencing depth, not by the input material. Consequently, counts must undergo normalization prior to use. Conventional normalization methods require a set of assumptions: they assume that the majority of features are unchanged and that all environments under study have the same carrying capacity for nucleotide synthesis. These assumptions are often untestable and may not hold when heterogeneous samples are compared.

Results

Methods developed within the field of compositional data analysis offer a general solution that is assumption-free and valid for all data. Herein, we synthesize the extant literature to provide a concise guide on how to apply compositional data analysis to NGS count data.

Conclusions

In highlighting the limitations of total library size, effective library size, and spike-in normalizations, we propose the log-ratio transformation as a general solution to answer the question, ``Relative to some important activity of the cell, what is changing?''},

 abstract = {Since the turn of the century, technological advances have made it possible to obtain the molecular profile of any tissue in a cost-effective manner. Among these advances are sophisticated high-throughput assays that measure the relative abundances of microorganisms, RNA molecules, and metabolites. While these data are most often collected to gain new insights into biological systems, they can also be used as biomarkers to create clinically useful diagnostic classifiers. How best to classify high-dimensional -omics data remains an area of active research. However, few explicitly model the relative nature of these data and instead rely on cumbersome normalizations. This report (i) emphasizes the relative nature of health biomarkers, (ii) discusses the literature surrounding the classification of relative data, and (iii) benchmarks how different transformations perform for regularized logistic regression across multiple biomarker types. We show how an interpretable set of log contrasts, called balances, can prepare data for classification. We propose a simple procedure, called discriminative balance analysis, to select groups of 2 and 3 bacteria that can together discriminate between experimental conditions. Discriminative balance analysis is a fast, accurate, and interpretable alternative to data normalization.IMPORTANCE High-throughput sequencing provides an easy and cost-effective way to measure the relative abundance of bacteria in any environmental or biological sample. When these samples come from humans, the microbiome signatures can act as biomarkers for disease prediction. However, because bacterial abundance is measured as a composition, the data have unique properties that make conventional analyses inappropriate. To overcome this, analysts often use cumbersome normalizations. This article proposes an alternative method that identifies pairs and trios of bacteria whose stoichiometric presence can differentiate between diseased and nondiseased samples. By using interpretable log contrasts called balances, we developed an entirely normalization-free classification procedure that reduces the feature space and improves the interpretability, without sacrificing classifier performance.},

It is not possible to interpret any one component in isolation. The ﬁeld of compositional data analysis has emerged with alternative methods for relative data based on log-ratio transforms. However, these data often contain many more features than samples, and thus require creative new ways to reduce the dimensionality of the data. The summation of parts, called amalgamation, is a practical way of reducing dimensionality, but can introduce a non-linear distortion to the data. We exploit this non-linearity to propose a powerful yet interpretable dimension method called data-driven amalgamation. Our new method, implemented in the user-friendly R package amalgam, can reduce the dimensionality of compositional data by ﬁnding amalgamations that optimally (i) preserve the distance between samples, or (ii) classify samples as diseased or not. Our benchmark on 13 real datasets conﬁrm that these amalgamations compete with state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance, but result in new features that are easily understood: they are groups of parts added together.},

 abstract = {The consumption of crops fertilized with human waste represents a potential route of exposure to antibiotic-resistant fecal bacteria. The present study evaluated the abundance of bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes by using both culture-dependent and molecular methods. Various vegetables (lettuce, carrots, radish, and tomatoes) were sown into field plots fertilized inorganically or with class B biosolids or untreated municipal sewage sludge and harvested when of marketable quality. Analysis of viable pathogenic bacteria or antibiotic-resistant coliform bacteria by plate counts did not reveal significant treatment effects of fertilization with class B biosolids or untreated sewage sludge on the vegetables. Numerous targeted genes associated with antibiotic resistance and mobile genetic elements were detected by PCR in soil and on vegetables at harvest from plots that received no organic amendment. However, in the season of application, vegetables harvested from plots treated with either material carried gene targets not detected in the absence of amendment. Several gene targets evaluated by using quantitative PCR (qPCR) were considerably more abundant on vegetables harvested from sewage sludge-treated plots than on vegetables from control plots in the season of application, whereas vegetables harvested the following year revealed no treatment effect. Overall, the results of the present study suggest that producing vegetable crops in ground fertilized with human waste without appropriate delay or pretreatment will result in an additional burden of antibiotic resistance genes on harvested crops. Managing human exposure to antibiotic resistance genes carried in human waste must be undertaken through judicious agricultural practice.},

Inappropriate application and storage of these chemicals often contaminate plant tissues, air, water, or soil environments. The presence of pesticides can lead to developing tolerance, resistance or persistence and even the capabilities to degrade them by the microbiomes of theses environments. The pesticide-degrading microorganisms gain and employ several mechanisms for attraction (chemotaxis), membrane transport systems, efflux pumps, enzymes and genetical make-up with plasmid and chromosome encoded catabolic genes for degradation. Even the evolution and the mechanisms of inheritance for pesticide-degradation as a functional trait in several microorganisms are beginning to be understood. Because of the commonalities in the microbial responses of sensing and uptake, and adaptation due to the selection pressures of pesticides and antimicrobial substances including antibiotics, the pesticide-degraders have higher chances of possessing antimicrobial resistance as a surplus functional trait. This review critically examines the probabilities of pesticide contamination of soil and foliage, the knowledge gaps in the regulation and storage of pesticide chemicals, and the human implications of pesticide-degrading microorganisms with antimicrobial resistance in the global strategy of 'One Health'.},

 abstract = {Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are a growing threat to humans across the world. Antibiotic resistance is a global problem that has developed through continuous antibiotic use, combinatorial antibiotic use, pesticide-antibiotic cross-resistance, and horizontal gene transfer, as well as various other modes. Pesticide-antibiotic cross-resistance and the subsequent expansion of drug-resistant bacteria are critically documented in this review, the primary focus of which is to assess the impact of indiscriminate pesticide use on the development of microbial communities with parallel pesticide and multidrug resistance. The consumption of pesticide-contaminated food products and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics by humans and in livestock animals have favored the development of both antibiotic and pesticide-resistant bacterial flora via natural selection. Pesticide resistance mainly develops through defensive bacterial adaptations such as biofilm formation, induced mutations, and horizontal/vertical gene transfer through plasmids or transposons, as well as through the increased expression of certain hydrolytic enzymes. Pesticide resistance genes are always transferred as gene clusters, and they may also carry genes essential for antibiotic resistance. Moreover, for some induced mutations, the mutated active site of the affected enzyme may allow degradation of both pesticides and antibiotics, resulting in cross-resistance. A few studies have shown that the sub-lethal exposure of wild-type strains to herbicides induces antibiotic resistance. This review concludes that xenobiotic exposure leads to cross-resistance in wild microbial flora, which requires further study to develop therapeutic approaches to overcome the threats of MDR bacteria and superbugs.},

 abstract = {Despite an exceptional number of bacterial cells and species in soils, bacterial diversity seems to have little effect on soil processes, such as respiration or nitrification, that can be affected by interactions between bacterial cells. The aim of this study is to understand how bacterial cells are distributed in soil to better understand the scaling between cell-to-cell interactions and what can be measured in a few milligrams, or more, of soil. Based on the analysis of 744 images of observed bacterial distributions in soil thin sections taken at different depths, we found that the inter-cell distance was, on average 12.46 µm and that these inter-cell distances were shorter near the soil surface (10.38 µm) than at depth ({\textgreater}18 µm), due to changes in cell densities. These images were also used to develop a spatial statistical model, based on Log Gaussian Cox Processes, to analyse the 2D distribution of cells and construct realistic 3D bacterial distributions. Our analyses suggest that despite the very high number of cells and species in soil, bacteria only interact with a few other individuals. For example, at bacterial densities commonly found in bulk soil (10(8) cells g(-1) soil), the number of neighbours a single bacterium has within an interaction distance of ca. 20 µm is relatively limited (120 cells on average). Making conservative assumptions about the distribution of species, we show that such neighbourhoods contain less than 100 species. This value did not change appreciably as a function of the overall diversity in soil, suggesting that the diversity of soil bacterial communities may be species-saturated. All in all, this work provides precise data on bacterial distributions, a novel way to model them at the micrometer scale as well as some new insights on the degree of interactions between individual bacterial cells in soils.},

@article{Razavi.2017,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Over the past 75~years, human pathogens have acquired antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), often from environmental bacteria. Integrons play a major role in the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes. We therefore hypothesized that focused exploration of integron gene cassettes from microbial communities could be an efficient way to find novel mobile resistance genes. DNA from polluted Indian river sediments were amplified using three sets of primers targeting class 1 integrons and sequenced by long- and short-read technologies to maintain both accuracy and context.

RESULTS

Up to 89{\%} of identified open reading frames encode known resistance genes, or variations thereof ({\textgreater} 1000). We identified putative novel ARGs to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, trimethoprim, rifampicin, and chloramphenicol, including several novel OXA variants, providing reduced susceptibility to carbapenems. One dihydropteroate synthase gene, with less than 34{\%} amino acid identity to the three known mobile sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1-3), provided complete resistance when expressed in Escherichia coli. The mobilized gene, here named sul4, is the first mobile sulfonamide resistance gene discovered since 2003. Analyses of adjacent DNA suggest that sul4 has been decontextualized from a set of chromosomal genes involved in folate synthesis in its original host, likely within the phylum Chloroflexi. The presence of an insertion sequence common region element could provide mobility to the entire integron. Screening of 6489 metagenomic datasets revealed that sul4 is already widespread in seven countries across Asia and Europe.

CONCLUSIONS

Our findings show that exploring integrons from environmental communities with a history of antibiotic exposure can provide an efficient way to find novel, mobile resistance genes. The mobilization of a fourth sulfonamide resistance gene is likely to provide expanded opportunities for sulfonamide resistance to spread, with potential impacts on both human and animal health.},

 abstract = {Insertion sequences (ISs) are abundant mobile genetic elements on bacterial genomes, responsible for mobilization of many genes, including antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). As ARGs often occur in similar genetic contexts, understanding which ISs tend to be associated with known ARGs could be a first step toward discovering novel ARGs through predictive or experimental strategies. This could be valuable, as early identification of ARGs in pathogens could facilitate surveillance, confinement actions, molecular diagnostics, and drug development. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the association of specific ISs with known ARGs. A large collection of bacterial genomes was used to characterize the immediate context of 2,437 known ARGs and 3,768 ISs. While many ARGs were consistently found close to specific ISs, the contexts around all ISs were more variable. Nevertheless, a subset of individual ISs, as well as tentative composite transposons, showed significant associations with ARGs. These included, e.g., insertion sequences classified as IS6, Tn3, IS4, and IS1 that were not only strongly associated with diverse ARGs but also highly abundant in pathogens. Therefore, we conclude that the context of this subset of ISs and tentative composite transposons would be particularly valuable to discover novel ARGs through modeling or empirical approaches. A set of 1,891 metagenomes were analyzed to identify environments where those ISs commonly associated with ARGs were particularly abundant. The associations found in metagenomes were similar to those found in genomes.IMPORTANCE The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among pathogens threaten the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections as well as our food production chains. Early knowledge about mobile ARGs that are present in pathogens or that have the potential to become clinically relevant could help mitigate potential negative consequences. Recently, exploring integron gene cassettes was shown to be successful for identifying novel mobilized ARGs, some of which were already circulating in pathogens. Still, only a subset of ARGs is mobilized by integrons, and the contexts of other mobile genetic elements associated with ARGs remain unexplored. This includes insertion sequences (ISs) responsible for the mobilization of many ARGs. Our analyses identified ISs, species, and environments where ARG-IS relationships are particularly strong. This could be a first step to guide the discovery of novel ARGs, while also providing insights into mechanisms involved in the mobilization and transfer of ARGs.},

Improved management of the use of antimicrobials in food animals, particularly reducing those critically important for human medicine, is an important step towards preserving the benefits of antimicrobials for people. WHO has developed and applied criteria to rank antimicrobials according to their relative importance in human medicine. Clinicians, regulatory agencies, policy-makers and other stakeholders can use this ranking when developing risk management strategies for the use of antimicrobials in food production animals. The use of the list will help preserve the effectiveness of currently available antimicrobials. The first WHO list of CIA was developed in the 1st WHO Expert Meeting on Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Health held in Canberra, Australia, 2005. During the meeting, participants considered the list of all antimicrobial classes used in human medicine and categorized antimicrobials into three groups of critically important, highly important, and important based on the two criteria developed during the meeting. The 1st revision of the WHO list of CIA was developed in the 2nd WHO Expert Meeting on Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Health held in Copenhagen, Denmark, 2007. In this meeting, participants reviewed the two criteria and re-examined the categorization of all human antibacterial classes to prepare the 2nd edition of the list. Participants also prioritized agents within the critically important category in order to allow allocation of resources on the agents for which management of the risks from antimicrobial resistance are needed most urgently. The list has subsequently been re-examined and updated during WHO-AGISAR expert meetings held in Copenhagen in 2009 (2nd revision), in Oslo, Norway in 2011 (3rd revision), in Bogota, Colombia in 2013 (4th revision) and in Raleigh, USA (5th revision).{\textquotedbl}--},

It is thus important to measure the full implications of environmental changes on the sustainability of aquaculture.

We calculate a Multi-Antibiotic Resistance index (MAR) of aquaculture-related bacteria (11,274 isolates) for 40 countries, of which mostly low- and middle-income countries present high AMR levels. Here we show that aquaculture MAR indices correlate with MAR indices from human clinical bacteria, temperature and countries' climate vulnerability. We also find that infected aquatic animals present higher mortalities at warmer temperatures. Countries most vulnerable to climate change will probably face the highest AMR risks, impacting human health beyond the aquaculture sector, highlighting the need for urgent action.

These methods do not access the potential reservoir of undiscovered antibiotic resistance genes harboured by soil bacteria because most soil bacteria are not cultured readily, and PCR detection of antibiotic resistance genes depends on primers that are based on known genes. To explore this reservoir, we isolated DNA directly from soil samples, cloned the DNA and selected for clones that expressed antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli. We constructed four libraries that collectively contain 4.1 gigabases of cloned soil DNA. From these and two previously reported libraries, we identified nine clones expressing resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics and one expressing tetracycline resistance. Based on the predicted amino acid sequences of the resistance genes, the resistance mechanisms include efflux of tetracycline and inactivation of aminoglycoside antibiotics by phosphorylation and acetylation. With one exception, all the sequences are considerably different from previously reported sequences. The results indicate that soil bacteria are a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes with greater genetic diversity than previously accounted for, and that the diversity can be surveyed by a culture-independent method.},

 abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technologies have revolutionized microbiome research by allowing the relative quantification of microbiome composition and function in different environments. In this work we focus on the identification of microbial signatures, groups of microbial taxa that are predictive of a phenotype of interest. We do this by acknowledging the compositional nature of the microbiome and the fact that it carries relative information. Thus, instead of defining a microbial signature as a linear combination in real space corresponding to the abundances of a group of taxa, we consider microbial signatures given by the geometric means of data from two groups of taxa whose relative abundances, or balance, are associated with the response variable of interest. In this work we present selbal, a greedy stepwise algorithm for selection of balances or microbial signatures that preserves the principles of compositional data analysis. We illustrate the algorithm with 16S rRNA abundance data from a Crohn's microbiome study and an HIV microbiome study. IMPORTANCE We propose a new algorithm for the identification of microbial signatures. These microbial signatures can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, or prediction of therapeutic response based on an individual's specific microbiota.},

 abstract = {Urban wastewater treatment plants (UWTPs) are among the main sources of antibiotics' release into the environment. The occurrence of antibiotics may promote the selection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), which shade health risks to humans and animals. In this paper the fate of ARB and ARGs in UWTPs, focusing on different processes/technologies (i.e., biological processes, advanced treatment technologies and disinfection), was critically reviewed. The mechanisms by which biological processes influence the development/selection of ARB and ARGs transfer are still poorly understood. Advanced treatment technologies and disinfection process are regarded as a major tool to control the spread of ARB into the environment. In spite of intense efforts made over the last years to bring solutions to control antibiotic resistance spread in the environment, there are still important gaps to fill in. In particular, it is important to: (i) improve risk assessment studies in order to allow accurate estimates about the maximal abundance of ARB in UWTPs effluents that would not pose risks for human and environmental health; (ii) understand the factors and mechanisms that drive antibiotic resistance maintenance and selection in wastewater habitats. The final objective is to implement wastewater treatment technologies capable of assuring the production of UWTPs effluents with an acceptable level of ARB.},

However, the strain typing information that is available has been insufficient for estimating the total number of macrolide-resistant clones, their geographic distributions, and their evolutionary relationships. In this study, sequence-based strain typing was used to characterize 212 MRGAS isolates from 34 countries. Evaluation of clonal complexes, emm type, and resistance gene content [erm(A), erm(B), mef(A), and undefined] indicate that macrolide resistance was acquired by GAS organisms via {\textgreater} or independent genetic events. In contrast to other collections of mostly susceptible GAS, genetic diversification of MRGAS clones has occurred primarily by mutation rather than by recombination. Twenty-two MRGAS clonal complexes were recovered from more than one continent; intercontinental strains represent nearly 80{\%} of the MRGAS isolates under study. The findings suggest that horizontal transfer of macrolide resistance genes to numerous genetic backgrounds and global dissemination of resistant clones and their descendants are both major components of the present-day macrolide resistance problem found within this species.},

It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

However, despite an immense amount of data generated, systematic, cross-environment analyses of microbiome responses to multiple disturbances are lacking. Here, we present the Microbiome Stress Project, an open-access database of environmental and host-associated 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing studies collected to facilitate cross-study analyses of microbiome responses to stressors. This database will comprise published and unpublished datasets re-processed from the raw sequences into exact sequence variants using our standardized computational pipeline. Our database will provide insight into general response patterns of microbiome diversity, structure, and stability to environmental stressors. It will also enable the identification of cross-study associations between single or multiple stressors and specific microbial clades. Here, we present a proof-of-concept meta-analysis of 606 microbiomes (from nine studies) to assess microbial community responses to: (1) one stressor in one environment: soil warming across a variety of soil types, (2) a range of stressors in one environment: soil microbiome responses to a comprehensive set of stressors (incl. temperature, diesel, antibiotics, land use change, drought, and heavy metals), (3) one stressor across a range of environments: copper exposure effects on soil, sediment, activated-sludge reactors, and gut environments, and (4) the general trends of microbiome stressor responses. Overall, we found that stressor exposure significantly decreases microbiome alpha diversity and increases beta diversity (community dispersion) across a range of environments and stressor types. We observed a hump-shaped relationship between microbial community resistance to stressors (i.e., the average pairwise similarity score between the control and stressed communities) and alpha diversity. We used Phylofactor to identify microbial clades and individual taxa as potential bioindicators of copper contamination across different environments. Using standardized computational and statistical methods, the Microbiome Stress Project will leverage thousands of existing datasets to build a general framework for how microbial communities respond to environmental stress.},

 abstract = {Plasmids have a key role in bacterial ecology and evolution because they mobilize accessory genes by horizontal gene transfer. However, recent studies have revealed that the evolutionary impact of plasmids goes above and beyond their being mere gene delivery platforms. Plasmids are usually kept at multiple copies per cell, producing islands of polyploidy in the bacterial genome. As a consequence, the evolution of plasmid-encoded genes is governed by a set of rules different from those affecting chromosomal genes, and these rules are shaped by unusual concepts in bacterial genetics, such as genetic dominance, heteroplasmy or segregational drift. In this Review, we discuss recent advances that underscore the importance of plasmids in bacterial ecology and evolution beyond horizontal gene transfer. We focus on new evidence that suggests that plasmids might accelerate bacterial evolution, mainly by promoting the evolution of plasmid-encoded genes, but also by enhancing the adaptation of their host chromosome. Finally, we integrate the most relevant theoretical and empirical studies providing a global understanding of the forces that govern plasmid-mediated evolution in bacteria.},

This is the first study of this kind performed at an international level. Within the 53 antibiotics monitored 17 were detected at least once in the final effluent of the WWTPs, i.e.: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enrofloxacin, orbifloxacin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid, oxolinic acid, cefalexin, clindamycin, metronidazole, ampicillin, and tetracycline. The countries exhibiting the highest effluent average concentrations of antibiotics were Ireland and the southern countries Portugal and Spain, whereas the northern countries (Norway, Finland and Germany) and Cyprus exhibited lower total concentration. The antibiotic occurrence data in the final effluents were used for the assessment of their impact on the aquatic environment. Both, environmental predicted no effect concentration (PNEC-ENVs) and the PNECs based on minimal inhibitory concentrations (PNEC-MICs) were considered for the evaluation of the impact on microbial communities in aquatic systems and on the evolution of antibiotic resistance, respectively. Based on this analysis, three compounds, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin and cefalexin are proposed as markers of antibiotic pollution, as they could occasionally pose a risk to the environment. Integrated studies like this are crucial to map the impact of antibiotic pollution and to provide the basis for designing water quality and environmental risk in regular water monitoring programs.},

 abstract = {Estimations of microbial community diversity based on metagenomic data sets are affected, often to an unknown degree, by biases derived from insufficient coverage and reference database-dependent estimations of diversity. For instance, the completeness of reference databases cannot be generally estimated since it depends on the extant diversity sampled to date, which, with the exception of a few habitats such as the human gut, remains severely undersampled. Further, estimation of the degree of coverage of a microbial community by a metagenomic data set is prohibitively time-consuming for large data sets, and coverage values may not be directly comparable between data sets obtained with different sequencing technologies. Here, we extend Nonpareil, a database-independent tool for the estimation of coverage in metagenomic data sets, to a high-performance computing implementation that scales up to hundreds of cores and includes, in addition, a k-mer-based estimation as sensitive as the original alignment-based version but about three hundred times as fast. Further, we propose a metric of sequence diversity (Nd ) derived directly from Nonpareil curves that correlates well with alpha diversity assessed by traditional metrics. We use this metric in different experiments demonstrating the correlation with the Shannon index estimated on 16S rRNA gene profiles and show that Nd additionally reveals seasonal patterns in marine samples that are not captured by the Shannon index and more precise rankings of the magnitude of diversity of microbial communities in different habitats. Therefore, the new version of Nonpareil, called Nonpareil 3, advances the toolbox for metagenomic analyses of microbiomes. IMPORTANCE Estimation of the coverage provided by a metagenomic data set, i.e., what fraction of the microbial community was sampled by DNA sequencing, represents an essential first step of every culture-independent genomic study that aims to robustly assess the sequence diversity present in a sample. However, estimation of coverage remains elusive because of several technical limitations associated with high computational requirements and limiting statistical approaches to quantify diversity. Here we described Nonpareil 3, a new bioinformatics algorithm that circumvents several of these limitations and thus can facilitate culture-independent studies in clinical or environmental settings, independent of the sequencing platform employed. In addition, we present a new metric of sequence diversity based on rarefied coverage and demonstrate its use in communities from diverse ecosystems.},

However, there are concerns about the development of antimicrobial resistance in foodborne pathogens due to widespread biocide usage. In our study, 93 L. monocytogenes isolates from German food production facilities were (i) tested for biocide and antibiotic susceptibility using broth microdilution assays, (ii) analyzed for links between reduced biocide susceptibility and antibiotic resistance, and (iii) characterized by whole-genome sequencing, including the detection of genes coding for biocide tolerance, antibiotic resistance, and other virulence factors. Fifteen L. monocytogenes isolates were tolerant to benzalkonium chloride (BAC), and genes conferring BAC tolerance were found in 13 of them. Antibiotic resistance was not associated with biocide tolerance. BAC-tolerant isolates were assigned to 6 multilocus sequence type (MLST) clonal complexes, and most of them harbored internalin A pseudogenes with premature stop codons or deletions (n = 9). Our study demonstrated a high genetic diversity among the investigated isolates including genotypes that are frequently involved in human infections. Although in vitro adaptation studies to biocides have raised concerns about increasing cross-resistance to antibiotics, our results do not provide evidence for this phenomenon in field isolates.IMPORTANCE Foodborne pathogens such as L. monocytogenes can persist in food production environments for a long time, causing perennial outbreaks. Hence, bacterial pathogens are able to survive cleaning and disinfection procedures. Accordingly, they may be repeatedly exposed to sublethal concentrations of disinfectants, which might result in bacterial adaptation to these biocides. Furthermore, antibiotic coresistance and cross-resistance are known to evolve under biocide selection pressure in vitro Hence, antimicrobial tolerance seems to play a crucial role in the resilience and persistence of foodborne pathogens in the food chain and might reduce therapeutic options in infectious diseases.},

In this work, we quantified a set of ARGs in the bacterial and bacteriophage fractions of agricultural soil by quantitative PCR. All tested ARGs were present in both the bacterial and phage fractions. We demonstrate that fertilization of soil with dairy manure or human biosolids increases ARG abundance in the bacterial fraction but not the bacteriophage fraction and further show that pretreatment of dairy manure can impact ARG abundance in the bacterial fraction. Finally, we show that purified bacteriophage can confer increased antibiotic resistance to soil bacteria when combined with selective pressure. The results indicate that soilborne bacteriophage represents a substantial reservoir of antibiotic resistance and that bacteriophage could play a significant role in the horizontal transfer of resistance genes in the context of an agricultural soil microbiome. Overall, our work reinforces the advisability of composting or digesting fecal material prior to field application and suggests that application of some antibiotics at subclinical concentrations can promote bacteriophage-mediated horizontal transfer of ARGs in agricultural soil microbiomes.},

 abstract = {Motivation

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains a major threat to global health. Profiling the collective AMR genes within a metagenome (the 'resistome') facilitates greater understanding of AMR gene diversity and dynamics. In turn, this can allow for gene surveillance, individualized treatment of bacterial infections and more sustainable use of antimicrobials. However, resistome profiling can be complicated by high similarity between reference genes, as well as the sheer volume of sequencing data and the complexity of analysis workflows. We have developed an efficient and accurate method for resistome profiling that addresses these complications and improves upon currently available tools.

Results

Our method combines a variation graph representation of gene sets with a locality-sensitive hashing Forest indexing scheme to allow for fast classification of metagenomic sequence reads using similarity-search queries. Subsequent hierarchical local alignment of classified reads against graph traversals enables accurate reconstruction of full-length gene sequences using a scoring scheme. We provide our implementation, graphing Resistance Out Of meTagenomes (GROOT), and show it to be both faster and more accurate than a current reference-dependent tool for resistome profiling. GROOT runs on a laptop and can process a typical 2 gigabyte metagenome in 2 min using a single CPU. Our method is not restricted to resistome profiling and has the potential to improve current metagenomic workflows.

In this work, the occurrence and distribution of alkyltrimethylammonium (ATMAC), benzylakyldimethylethylammonium (BAC) and dialkyldimethylammonium (DADMAC) homologues were investigated in fifty-two municipal sewage sludge samples. ATMAC C10-18, BAC C8-18 and paired DADMAC C8:8-C18:18 as well as emerging homologues such as ATMAC-20, 22 and mixed DADMAC-16:18 and 14:16 were present. Furthermore, paired DADMAC-20:20 and mixed DADMAC-14:18, 18:20 were identified for the first time by nontarget qualitative strategies. A triple quadruple mass spectrometer quantification method was also initially verified with the aid of laboratory synthesized standards for the analysis of the mixed DADMACs with no certificated commercial standards currently available. The total concentrations of ATMACs, BACs and DADMACs were in the range of 0.38-293, 0.09-191 and 0.64-344 \textgreek{m}g/g dry weight, respectively, and particularly, mixed DADMACs constituted 39 $\pm$ 7{\%} of total DADMAC concentrations. The concentrations and profiles of individual homologues further suggested different QAC applications and fate in China. Significant correlations were also found among the concentrations of various QAC homologues as well as wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) characteristics (total organic carbon contents and daily treatment volumes).},

Most of the genes conferring resistance are acquired horizontally from already resistant commensal or environmental bacteria. Food contamination by resistant bacteria might be a significant source of resistance genes for human bacteria but has never been precisely assessed, nor is it known whether organic products differ in this respect from conventionally produced products. We showed here, on a large year-long constructed sample set containing 399 products that, irrespective of their mode of production, raw fruits and vegetables are heavily contaminated by Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) resistant to multiple antibiotics. Most of these bacteria originate in the soil and environment. We focused on non-oxidative GNB resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, because of their potential impact on human health. Among them, species potentially pathogenic for immunocompetent hosts were rare. Of the products tested, 13{\%} carried bacteria producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, all identified as Rahnella sp. which grouped into two phylotypes and all carrying the bla(RAHN) gene. Thus, both organic and conventional fruits and vegetables may constitute significant sources of resistant bacteria and of resistance genes.},

@article{RuizMartinez.2011,
 abstract = {The aims of this study were to ascertain the presence and spread of class 1 integrons amongst environmental and clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to characterise their variable regions. A total of 76 isolates (56 clinical and 20 environmental) were studied. The presence of plasmids was explored, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for integron detection. All amplicons were sequenced. PCR detected class 1 integrons in 26 of the 56 clinical isolates; environmental isolates were integron-free. No plasmids were found, thus all the integrons found are possibly on the chromosome. Most isolates presented one amplicon, except PA110514 and PA116136, which showed two PCR products each. Variable regions revealed that 18 strains carried only one gene involved in aminoglycoside resistance, whereas in 3 strains gene cassettes were not found. The most prevalent cassettes amongst isolates were those encoding aminoglycoside adenyltransferase B (aadB). Several of the strains had acquired the same or a highly similar cassette array as those detected in geographically distant P. aeruginosa. This finding suggests that contact with bacterial reservoirs contributes to the evolution of this pathogen towards multiresistance. Empty structures found may represent a reservoir increasing the capacity to adapt to the environment. However, these integrons are not retained when the selective pressure disappears. It is hypothesised that integrons containing gene cassettes are crucial vehicles for the rapid horizontal transfer of resistance. If this is so, reduced use of antibiotics may lead to a significant decrease in the carriage of integrons amongst P. aeruginosa strains.},

 abstract = {The intestinal microbiota is considered to be a major reservoir of antibiotic resistance determinants (ARDs) that could potentially be transferred to bacterial pathogens via mobile genetic elements. Yet, this assumption is poorly supported by empirical evidence due to the distant homologies between known ARDs (mostly from culturable bacteria) and ARDs from the intestinal microbiota. Consequently, an accurate census of intestinal ARDs (that is, the intestinal resistome) has not yet been fully determined. For this purpose, we developed and validated an annotation method (called pairwise comparative modelling) on the basis of a three-dimensional structure (homology comparative modelling), leading to the prediction of 6,095 ARDs in a catalogue of 3.9 million proteins from the human intestinal microbiota. We found that the majority of predicted ARDs (pdARDs) were distantly related to known ARDs (mean amino acid identity 29.8{\%}) and found little evidence supporting their transfer between species. According to the composition of their resistome, we were able to cluster subjects from the MetaHIT cohort (n = 663) into six resistotypes that were connected to the previously described enterotypes. Finally, we found that the relative abundance of pdARDs was positively associated with gene richness, but not when subjects were exposed to antibiotics. Altogether, our results indicate that the majority of intestinal microbiota ARDs can be considered intrinsic to the dominant commensal microbiota and that these genes are rarely shared with bacterial pathogens.},

@article{Rutgersson.2020,
 abstract = {The widespread practice of applying sewage sludge to arable land makes use of nutrients indispensable for crops and reduces the need for inorganic fertilizer, however this application also provides a potential route for human exposure to chemical contaminants and microbial pathogens in the sludge. A recent concern is that such practice could promote environmental selection and dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria or resistance genes. Understanding the risks of sludge amendment in relation to antibiotic resistance development is important for sustainable agriculture, waste treatment and infectious disease management. To assess such risks, we took advantage of an agricultural field trial in southern Sweden, where land used for growing different crops has been amended with sludge every four years since 1981. We sampled raw, semi-digested and digested and stored sludge together with soils from the experimental plots before and two weeks after the most recent amendment in 2017. Levels of selected antimicrobials and bioavailable metals were determined and microbial effects were evaluated using both culture-independent metagenome sequencing and conventional culturing. Antimicrobials or bioavailable metals (Cu and Zn) did not accumulate to levels of concern for environmental selection of antibiotic resistance, and no coherent signs, neither on short or long time scales, of enrichment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria or resistance genes were found in soils amended with digested and stored sewage sludge in doses up to 12 metric tons per hectare. Likewise, only very few and slight differences in microbial community composition were observed after sludge amendment. Taken together, the current study does not indicate risks of sludge amendment related to antibiotic resistance development under the given conditions. Extrapolations should however be done with care as sludge quality and application practices vary between regions. Hence, the antibiotic concentrations and resistance load of the sludge are likely to be higher in regions with larger antibiotic consumption and resistance burden than Sweden.},

Due to the fact that microbes live within communities, various mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer and types of mobile elements can co-occur. However, the ways in which horizontal gene transfer impacts and is impacted by communities containing diverse mobile elements has been challenging to address. Thus, the field would benefit from incorporating community-level information and novel approaches alongside existing methods. Emerging technologies for tracking mobile elements and assigning them to host organisms provide promise for understanding the web of potential DNA transfers in diverse microbial communities more comprehensively. Compared to existing experimental approaches, chromosome conformation capture and methylome analyses have the potential to simultaneously study various types of mobile elements and their associated hosts. We also briefly discuss how fermented food microbiomes, given their experimental tractability and moderate species complexity, make ideal models to which to apply the techniques discussed herein and how they can be used to address outstanding questions in the field of horizontal gene transfer in microbial communities.},

The vegetables were grown according to farming practices mandated by the province of Ontario Canada, the key feature being a one-year offset between biosolid application and the harvest of crops for human consumption. Biosolids at application, and crop samples following harvest were analyzed for 118 pharmaceuticals and transformation products, 17 hormones or hormone transformation products, and 6 parabens. Analyte concentrations in the biosolids were consistent with those detected in other surveys. Eight of the 141 analytes were detected in one or two crop replicates at concentrations ranging from 0.33 to 6.25 ng/g dry weight, but no analytes were consistently detected above the detection limit in all triplicate treated plots. Overall, this study suggests that the potential for micropollutant uptake into crops under normal farming conditions is low.},

In bacteria, DNA methylation has roles in genome defence, chromosome replication and segregation, nucleoid organization, cell cycle control, DNA repair and regulation of transcription. In many bacterial species, DNA methylation controls reversible switching (phase variation) of gene expression, a phenomenon that generates phenotypic cell variants. The formation of epigenetic lineages enables the adaptation of bacterial populations to harsh or changing environments and modulates the interaction of pathogens with their eukaryotic hosts.},

Here, we characterized the dsDNA viral diversity in biochar-amended agricultural soils at the preplanting and harvesting stages of a tomato growing season via paired total metagenomes and viral size fraction metagenomes (viromes). Size fractionation prior to DNA extraction reduced sources of nonviral DNA in viromes, enabling the recovery of a vaster richness of viral populations (vOTUs), greater viral taxonomic diversity, broader range of predicted hosts, and better access to the rare virosphere, relative to total metagenomes, which tended to recover only the most persistent and abundant vOTUs. Of 2961 detected vOTUs, 2684 were recovered exclusively from viromes, while only three were recovered from total metagenomes alone. Both viral and microbial communities differed significantly over time, suggesting a coupled response to rhizosphere recruitment processes and/or nitrogen amendments. Viral communities alone were also structured along an 18 m spatial gradient. Overall, our results highlight the utility of soil viromics and reveal similarities between viral and microbial community dynamics throughout the tomato growing season yet suggest a partial decoupling of the processes driving their spatial distributions, potentially due to differences in dispersal, decay rates, and/or sensitivities to soil heterogeneity.},

 abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common commensal and an opportunistic pathogen. Suspected pneumococcal upper respiratory infections and pneumonia are often treated with macrolide antibiotics. Macrolides are bacteriostatic antibiotics and inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. The widespread use of macrolides is associated with increased macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae, and the treatment of pneumococcal infections with macrolides may be associated with clinical failures. In S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistance is due to ribosomal dimethylation by an enzyme encoded by erm(B), efflux by a two-component efflux pump encoded by mef (E)/mel(msr(D)) and, less commonly, mutations of the ribosomal target site of macrolides. A wide array of genetic elements have emerged that facilitate macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae; for example erm(B) is found on Tn917, while the mef (E)/mel operon is carried on the 5.4- or 5.5-kb Mega element. The macrolide resistance determinants, erm(B) and mef (E)/mel, are also found on large composite Tn916-like elements most notably Tn6002, Tn2009, and Tn2010. Introductions of 7-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV-7 and PCV-13) have decreased the incidence of macrolide-resistant invasive pneumococcal disease, but serotype replacement and emergence of macrolide resistance remain an important concern.},

 abstract = {The estA gene encoding a novel cytoplasmic carboxylesterase from Arthrobacter nitroguajacolicus R{\"u}61a was expressed in Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis and secondary structure predictions suggested that EstA belongs to the family VIII esterases, which are related to class C beta-lactamases. The S-x-x-K motif that in beta-lactamases contains the catalytic nucleophile, and a putative active-site tyrosine residue are conserved in EstA. The native molecular mass of hexahistidine-tagged (His6) EstA, purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography, was estimated to be 95 kDa by gel filtration, whereas the His6EstA peptide has a calculated molecular mass of 42.1 kDa. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of short-chain phenylacyl esters and triglycerides, and shows weak activity toward 2-hydroxy- and 2-nitroacetanilide. Its catalytic activity was inhibited by the serine-specific effector phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and by Cd2+ and Hg2+ ions. Maximum activity of His6EstA was observed at a pH of 9.5 and a temperature of 50 degrees C to 60 degrees C. The enzyme was fairly thermostable. After 19 days at 50 degrees C and after 24 hours at 60 degrees C, its residual relative esterase activity toward phenylacetate was still 53{\%} and 30{\%}, respectively. Exposure of His6EstA to buffer-solvent mixtures showed that the enzyme was inactivated by several high log P (hydrophobic) solvents, whereas it showed remarkable stability and activity in up to 30{\%} (by volume) of polar (low log P) organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide, methanol, acetonitrile, acetone, and propanol.},

 abstract = {The impact of amendment with swine manure compost (SMC), yard waste compost (YWC), or food waste compost (FWC) on the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in soil was evaluated. Following a commercial-scale application of the composts in a field experiment, soils were sampled periodically for a decade, and archived air-dried. Soil DNA was extracted and gene targets quantified by qPCR. Compared with untreated control soil, all 3 amendment types increased the abundance of gene targets for up to 4 years postapplication. The abundance of several gene targets was much higher in soil amended with SMC than in soil receiving either YWC or FWC. The gene target ermB remained higher in the SMC treatment for a decade postapplication. Clostridia were significantly more abundant in the SMC-amended soil throughout the decade following application. Eight percent of Clostridium spp. isolates from the SMC treatment carried ermB. Overall, addition of organic amendments to soils has the potential to increase the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes. Amendments of fecal origin, such as SMC, will in addition entrain bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes. Environmentally recalcitrant clostridia, and the antibiotic resistance genes that they carry, will persist for many years under field conditions following the application of SMC.},

Since 1973, a median of 24 cases of foodborne botulism, 3 cases of wound botulism, and 71 cases of infant botulism have been reported annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). New vehicles for transmission have emerged in recent decades, and wound botulism associated with black tar heroin has increased dramatically since 1994. Recently, the potential terrorist use of botulinum toxin has become an important concern. Botulism is characterized by symmetric, descending, flaccid paralysis of motor and autonomic nerves, usually beginning with the cranial nerves. Blurred vision, dysphagia, and dysarthria are common initial complaints. The diagnosis of botulism is based on compatible clinical findings; history of exposure to suspect foods; and supportive ancillary testing to rule out other causes of neurologic dysfunction that mimic botulism, such as stroke, the Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. Laboratory confirmation of suspected cases is performed at the CDC and some state laboratories. Treatment includes supportive care and trivalent equine antitoxin, which reduces mortality if administered early. The CDC releases botulism antitoxin through an emergency distribution system. Although rare, botulism outbreaks are a public health emergency that require rapid recognition to prevent additional cases and to effectively treat patients. Because clinicians are the first to treat patients in any type of botulism outbreak, they must know how to recognize, diagnose, and treat this rare but potentially lethal disease.},

Urban wastes like biosolids are loaded with essential plant nutrients. In this view, agricultural use of biosolids would enable recycling of these nutrients and could be a sustainable approach towards management of this hugely generated waste. Therefore biosolids i.e. sewage sludge can serve as an important resource for agricultural utilization. Biosolids are characterized by the occurrence of beneficial plant nutrients (essential elements and micro and macronutrients) which can make help them to work as an effective soil amendment, thereby minimizing the reliance on chemical fertilizers. However, biosolids might contain toxic heavy metals that may limit its usage in the cropland. Heavy metals at higher concentration than the permissible limits may lead to food chain contamination and have fatal consequences. Biosolids amendment in soil can improve physical and nutrient property of soil depending on the quantity and portion of the mixture. Hence, biosolids can be a promising soil ameliorating supplement to increase plant productivity, reduce bioavailability of heavy metals and also lead to effective waste management.},

The 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences showed near identity to sequences found abutting a variety of different genes encoding resistance determinants. It is likely that the current structure arose by the integration of the 572-base-pair sequence containing the AAC(6')-II gene into a Tn21-related sequence at the recombinational hot spot, AAAGTT. We have compared the sequence of the AAC(6')-II gene to genes of other 6'-N-acetyltransferases. An AAC(6')-Ib protein (encoded by the aacA4 gene; G. Tran Van Nhieu and E. Collatz, J. Bacteriol. 169:5708-5714, 1987) that results in resistance to amikacin but not gentamicin was found to share 82{\%} sequence similarity with the AAC(6')-II protein.

Previous studies illustrate the antibiotic-like effect of many substances. However, whether and how commonly used or existing non-antibiotic metalloids (e.g., selenate) would enhance ARG spread remains poorly known. Here, we tracked the long-term operation of a bioreactor continuously fed with selenate for more than 1000 days. Metagenomic sequencing identified 191 different ARGs, of which the total abundance increased significantly after the amendment of selenate. Network analyses showed that ARGs resisting multiple drugs had very similar co-occurrence patterns, implying a potentially larger health risk. Host classification not only indicated multidrug-resistant species but also distinguished the mechanism of ARG enrichment for vertical transfer and horizontal gene transfer. Genome reconstruction of an ARG host suggested that selenate and its bioreduction product selenite could stimulate the overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species, which was confirmed by the direct measurement. Bacterial membrane permeability, type IV pilus formation, and DNA repair and recombination were also enhanced, together facilitating the horizontal acquirement of ARGs. Overall, this study for the first time highlights the ARG emergence and dissemination induced by a non-antibiotic metalloid and identifies ARG as a factor to consider in selenate bioremediation.},

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have facilitated the elucidation of the microbial community composition with higher accuracy and greater throughput than was previously achievable; however, the short sequencing reads often limit the microbial composition analysis at the species level due to the high similarity of 16S rRNA amplicon sequences. To overcome this limitation, we used the nanopore sequencing platform to sequence full-length 16S rRNA amplicon libraries prepared from the mouse gut microbiota. A comparison of the nanopore and short-read sequencing data showed that there were no significant differences in major taxonomic units (89{\%}) except one phylotype and three taxonomic units. Moreover, both sequencing data were highly similar at all taxonomic resolutions except the species level. At the species level, nanopore sequencing allowed identification of more species than short-read sequencing, facilitating the accurate classification of the bacterial community composition. Therefore, this method of full-length 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing will be useful for rapid, accurate and efficient detection of microbial diversity in various biological and clinical samples.},

The present work assessed sorption-desorption of CIP and AZ in biosolids and biosolids-amended soils using the {\textquotedbl}traditional{\textquotedbl} batch equilibration method. The batch equilibration method also included un-amended soils for comparison. Release potentials of the biosolids-borne antibiotics were assessed via multiple desorption equilibrations in the presence of CaCl2, soils, PbCl2, or competing antibiotic (CIP versus AZ) solutions. Desorption kinetics of CIP from biosolids were also evaluated by the diffusive gradient in thin films technique (DGT), coupled with a diffusion transport-exchange model available in 2D-DIFs. Sorption of both antibiotics followed linear models with partitioning coefficient (Kd) values for CIP ranging between 40 and 334 L kg-1 in soils and 357 L kg-1 in biosolids, and values for AZ ranging between 11 and 202 L kg-1 in soils and 428 L kg-1 in biosolids. Antibiotic desorption from the biosolids was highly hysteretic (hysteresis coefficients {\textless} 0.003) and desorption of the biosolids-borne chemicals was extremely small ({\textless}3{\%}) using any of the various desorption equilibration approaches. Desorption was hysteric in soils too; where desorption percentages were 4, 5, and 26{\%} for CIP and 6, 32, and 50{\%} for AZ in the silt loam soil, manured sand, and sand, respectively. CIP release from biosolids determined by DGT was also small ({\textless}1{\%}), ascribed to low dissolved and labile concentrations in the solid phase and a small effective diffusion coefficient. Results obtained using equilibrium and dynamic approaches suggest that the target antibiotic bioaccessibilities from biosolids and finer-textured (typical agricultural) soils would be minimal and that biosolids (not soils) control desorption of the two biosolids-borne chemicals.},

 abstract = {Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and azithromycin (AZ) are commonly prescribed antibiotics for various infections in humans and are frequently detected in biosolids. Ecological and human health risks from biosolids-borne CIP and AZ are not well understood, but necessary for formulating policies on safe use and management of biosolids. A tiered integrated risk assessment (IRA), based on the World Health Organization (WHO) framework and the USEPA Part 503 Biosolids Rule, was conducted to assess human and ecological health risks from biosolids-borne CIP and AZ. The IRA utilized the hazard quotient (HQ) approach to evaluate risks to various receptors of concern (including humans, animals, and birds) in sixteen exposure pathways and three conservative biosolids land application scenarios. The scenarios consisted of (i) single-heavy (100 Mg ha-1) land application of biosolids containing 95th percentile concentrations of CIP or AZ (USEPA, 2009), (ii) long-term (annual for 40-y) land application of biosolids containing typical (median; USEPA, 2009) CIP or AZ concentrations, and (iii) long-term (annual for 40-y) land application of biosolids containing the 95th percentile concentrations of CIP or AZ. The unrealistically conservative screening level (Tier 1) assessment identified three pathways of potential concern: biosolids $\rightarrow$ soil $\rightarrow$ plant (CIP); biosolids $\rightarrow$ soil $\rightarrow$ soil organism (CIP and AZ); and biosolids $\rightarrow$ soil $\rightarrow$ soil organism $\rightarrow$ predator (CIP and AZ). Subsequent tier (refined; more realistic) assessments and pollutant limits (calculated based on the USEPA Part 503 Biosolids Rule) suggested negligible human and ecological health risks from biosolids-borne CIP and AZ under real-world biosolids application scenarios. Pollutant concentration limits were 12 mg CIP kg-1 and 2.2 mg AZ kg-1; suggesting that pollutant load tracking is not needed for the majority (75{\%} for CIP and 90{\%} for AZ) of USA biosolids. Biosolids-borne antibiotic resistance (currently not addressed in any risk assessment model) is the principal uncertainty limiting risk assessment of biosolids-borne antibiotics including CIP and AZ.},

 abstract = {Information on bioavailability of two antibiotic TOrCs, ciprofloxacin (CIP) and azithromycin (AZ), to terrestrial organisms is severely limited, especially in the biosolids context. Responses of two terrestrial organisms, earthworms and microbes, to a range of environmentally relevant concentrations of biosolids-borne CIP and AZ were assessed in laboratory incubation studies involving 3H-labeled compounds. Earthworm assessments were based on the Earthworm Sub-chronic Toxicity Test (OCSPP 850.3100). Microbial impacts were assessed using respiration and reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (mRNA) analyses of nutrient (N and P) cycling genes as toxicity markers. Antibiotic extractability and stability during incubations were assessed using sequential extractions with CaCl2, methanol:water, and accelerated solvent extraction and analyses using thin layer chromatography. Subsample combustion, in addition to sequential extraction, recovered nearly 100{\%} of the added antibiotic. The two compounds persisted (estimated half-lives $\geq$ 3 y), but extractable fractions (especially of CIP) decreased over time. Neither biosolids-borne antibiotic significantly impacted overall respiration or N and P cycling. Microbial toxicity responses were minimal; complementary DNA (cDNA) concentrations of ammonia oxidizing bacterial genes were affected, but only initially. Similarly, earthworms showed no apparent response related to toxicity to environmentally relevant (and much greater) concentrations of biosolids-borne CIP and AZ. Earthworms, however, accumulated both compounds, and the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) values (dry weight basis) were {\~{}}4 (CIP) and {\~{}}7 (AZ) in depurated worms and {\~{}}20 (CIP and AZ) in un-depurated worms. The microbial and earthworm responses strongly to moderately correlated with {\textquotedbl}bioaccessible{\textquotedbl} fractions of the target TOrCs. The results suggest that biosolids-borne CIP and AZ toxicity to terrestrial microbes and earthworms is minimal, but there is a potential for target TOrC entry into ecological food web.},

 abstract = {Spread of biosolids-borne antibiotic resistance is a growing public and environmental health concern. Herein, we conducted incubation experiments involving biosolids, which are byproducts of sewage treatment processes, and biosolids-amended soil. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) was employed to assess responses of select antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile elements to environmentally relevant concentrations of two biosolids-borne antibiotics, azithromycin (AZ) and ciprofloxacin (CIP). Additionally, we examined sequence distribution of gyrA (encoding DNA gyrase; site of action of CIP) to assess potential shifts in genotype. Increasing antibiotic concentrations generally increased the transcriptional activities of qnrS (encoding CIP resistance) and ermB and mefE (encoding AZ resistance). The transcriptional activity of intl1, a marker of class 1 integrons, was unaffected by CIP or AZ concentrations, but biosolids amendment increased intl1 activity in the soil by 4 to 5 times, which persisted throughout incubation. While the dominant gyrA sequences found herein were unrelated to known CIP-resistant genotypes, the increasing CIP concentrations significantly decreased the diversity of genes encoding the DNA gyrase A subunit, suggesting changes in microbial community structures. This study suggests that biosolids harbor transcriptionally active ARGs and mobile elements that could survive and spread in biosolids-amended soils. However, more research is warranted to investigate these trends under field conditions. IMPORTANCE Although previous studies have indicated that biosolids may be important spreaders of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in environments, the potential activities of ARGs or their responses to environmental parameters have been understudied. This study highlights that certain biosolids-borne antibiotics can induce transcriptional activities of ARGs and mobile genetic elements in biosolids and biosolids-amended soil, even when present at environmentally relevant concentrations. Furthermore, these antibiotics can alter the structure of microbial populations expressing ARGs. Our findings indicate the bioavailability of the antibiotics in biosolids and provide evidence that biosolids can promote the activities and dissemination of ARGs and mobile genes in biosolids and soils that receive contaminated biosolids, thus, underscoring the importance of investigating anthropogenically induced antibiotic resistance in the environment under real-world scenarios.},

 abstract = {Targeted metagenomics, also known as metagenetics, is a high-throughput sequencing application focusing on a nucleotide target in a microbiome to describe its taxonomic content. A wide range of bioinformatics pipelines are available to analyze sequencing outputs, and the choice of an appropriate tool is crucial and not trivial. No standard evaluation method exists for estimating the accuracy of a pipeline for targeted metagenomics analyses. This article proposes an evaluation protocol containing real and simulated targeted metagenomics datasets, and adequate metrics allowing us to study the impact of different variables on the biological interpretation of results. This protocol was used to compare six different bioinformatics pipelines in the basic user context: Three common ones (mothur, QIIME and BMP) based on a clustering-first approach and three emerging ones (Kraken, CLARK and One Codex) using an assignment-first approach. This study surprisingly reveals that the effect of sequencing errors has a bigger impact on the results that choosing different amplified regions. Moreover, increasing sequencing throughput increases richness overestimation, even more so for microbiota of high complexity. Finally, the choice of the reference database has a bigger impact on richness estimation for clustering-first pipelines, and on correct taxa identification for assignment-first pipelines. Using emerging assignment-first pipelines is a valid approach for targeted metagenomics analyses, with a quality of results comparable to popular clustering-first pipelines, even with an error-prone sequencing technology like Ion Torrent. However, those pipelines are highly sensitive to the quality of databases and their annotations, which makes clustering-first pipelines still the only reliable approach for studying microbiomes that are not well described.},

 abstract = {The number and diversity of known prokaryotic insertion sequences (IS) have increased enormously since their discovery in the late 1960s. At present the sequences of more than 4000 different IS have been deposited in the specialized ISfinder database. Over time it has become increasingly apparent that they are important actors in the evolution of their host genomes and are involved in sequestering, transmitting, mutating and activating genes, and in the rearrangement of both plasmids and chromosomes. This review presents an overview of our current understanding of these transposable elements (TE), their organization and their transposition mechanism as well as their distribution and genomic impact. In spite of their diversity, they share only a very limited number of transposition mechanisms which we outline here. Prokaryotic IS are but one example of a variety of diverse TE which are being revealed due to the advent of extensive genome sequencing projects. A major conclusion from sequence comparisons of various TE is that frontiers between the different types are becoming less clear. We detail these receding frontiers between different IS-related TE. Several, more specialized chapters in this volume include additional detailed information concerning a number of these.In a second section of the review, we provide a detailed description of the expanding variety of IS, which we have divided into families for convenience. Our perception of these families continues to evolve and families emerge regularly as more IS are identified. This section is designed as an aid and a source of information for consultation by interested specialist readers.},

 abstract = {The environment is increasingly being recognized for the role it might play in the global spread of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance. Environmental regulators monitor and control many of the pathways responsible for the release of resistance-driving chemicals into the environment (e.g., antimicrobials, metals, and biocides). Hence, environmental regulators should be contributing significantly to the development of global and national antimicrobial resistance (AMR) action plans. It is argued that the lack of environment-facing mitigation actions included in existing AMR action plans is likely a function of our poor fundamental understanding of many of the key issues. Here, we aim to present the problem with AMR in the environment through the lens of an environmental regulator, using the Environment Agency (England's regulator) as an example from which parallels can be drawn globally. The issues that are pertinent to environmental regulators are drawn out to answer: What are the drivers and pathways of AMR? How do these relate to the normal work, powers and duties of environmental regulators? What are the knowledge gaps that hinder the delivery of environmental protection from AMR? We offer several thought experiments for how different mitigation strategies might proceed. We conclude that: (1) AMR Action Plans do not tackle all the potentially relevant pathways and drivers of AMR in the environment; and (2) AMR Action Plans are deficient partly because the science to inform policy is lacking and this needs to be addressed.},

 abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the acquisition of genetic material from non-parental lineages, is known to be important in bacterial evolution. In particular, HGT provides rapid access to genetic innovations, allowing traits such as virulence, antibiotic resistance and xenobiotic metabolism to spread through the human microbiome. Recent anecdotal studies providing snapshots of active gene flow on the human body have highlighted the need to determine the frequency of such recent transfers and the forces that govern these events. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a vast, human-associated network of gene exchange, large enough to directly compare the principal forces shaping HGT. We show that this network of 10,770 unique, recently transferred (more than 99{\%} nucleotide identity) genes found in 2,235 full bacterial genomes, is shaped principally by ecology rather than geography or phylogeny, with most gene exchange occurring between isolates from ecologically similar, but geographically separated, environments. For example, we observe 25-fold more HGT between human-associated bacteria than among ecologically diverse non-human isolates (P = 3.0 $\times$ 10(-270)). We show that within the human microbiome this ecological architecture continues across multiple spatial scales, functional classes and ecological niches with transfer further enriched among bacteria that inhabit the same body site, have the same oxygen tolerance or have the same ability to cause disease. This structure offers a window into the molecular traits that define ecological niches, insight that we use to uncover sources of antibiotic resistance and identify genes associated with the pathology of meningitis and other diseases.},

Overall, we found that 61{\%} and 7{\%} of the total abundance of ARGs found in drainage water samples could be attributed to manure enrichment and manure addition, respectively.

While most of these genes gradually decreased in abundance over time, the IS6100-associated tet(33) gene accrued. These results demonstrate the influence of manure applications on the composition of the resistome observed in agricultural drainage water and highlight the importance of anthropogenic ARGs in the environment.},

Plasmid transfer events from the donor to the recipient soil bacterial community were quantified and transconjugants were subsequently isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting and identified by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Transfer frequency of plasmid pKJK5 was reduced in bacterial communities extracted from highly Cu contaminated (4526~mg kg-1) soil compared to corresponding communities extracted from moderately (458~mg kg-1) Cu contaminated soil and a low Cu reference soil (15~mg kg-1). The taxonomic composition of the transconjugal pools showed remarkable similarities irrespective of the degree of soil Cu contamination and despite contrasting compositions of the extracted recipient communities and the original soil communities. Permissiveness assessed at the level of individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 16S rRNA gene 97{\%} sequence similarity threshold) was only slightly affected by soil Cu level and high replicate variability of OTU-level permissiveness indicated a role of stochastic events in IncP-1 plasmid transfer or strain-to-strain permissiveness variability.},

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of repeated exposure to different quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) on the susceptibility and/or resistance of bacteria to other QACs and antibiotics. Escherichia coli strains (n=10) were adapted by daily exposure to increasingly sub-inhibitory concentrations of a QAC for 7 days. Three QACs were studied. Following adaptation, we found similar levels of reduction in susceptibility to QACs with a mean 3-fold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to initial MIC values, whatever the QAC used during adaptation. No significant differences in antibiotic susceptibility were observed between the tested QACs. Antibiotic susceptibility was reduced from 3.5- to 7.5-fold for phenicol compounds, \textgreek{b} lactams, and quinolones. Increased MIC was associated with a shift in phenotype from susceptible to resistant for phenicol compounds (florfenicol and chloramphenicol) in 90{\%} of E. coli strains. Regardless of the QAC used for adaptation, exposure to gradually increasing concentrations of this type of disinfectant results in reduced susceptibility to QACs and antibiotics as well as cross-resistance to phenicol compounds in E. coli strains. Extensive use of QACs at sub-inhibitory concentrations may lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and may represent a public health risk.},

Our aim was to assess the effects of step-wise exposure to didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC) on the antimicrobial (antibiotics and biocides) susceptibilities of food-associated bacterial strains.

METHODS AND RESULTS

Adaptive responses of bacterial strains were investigated by exposing the strains daily to increasing subinhibitory concentrations of DDAC for 7~days. Following adaptation to DDAC, a threefold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for this biocide was observed in 48{\%} of the Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes strains, and 3{\%} of the Salmonella strains. Reduced susceptibility to other biocides was found with the most important increase in MIC for benzalkonium chloride (BC) and a commercial biocide formulation (Galox Horizon) containing DDAC and glutaraldehyde, for all species except Salmonella. Increase in antibiotic MIC values was more pronounced in E.~coli in terms of antibiotic numbers and of magnitude (from 4- to 32-fold increase) and, to a lesser extent, in Salmonella strains. Most of these strains had acquired resistance to ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin.

CONCLUSIONS

The effects of exposure to DDAC on biocides and antibiotics susceptibilities depend upon the bacteria species.

 abstract = {The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing problem and a public health issue. In recent decades, various genetic mechanisms involved in the spread of resistance genes among bacteria have been identified. Integrons - genetic elements that acquire, exchange, and express genes embedded within gene cassettes (GC) - are one of these mechanisms. Integrons are widely distributed, especially in Gram-negative bacteria; they are carried by mobile genetic elements, plasmids, and transposons, which promote their spread within bacterial communities. Initially studied mainly in the clinical setting for their involvement in antibiotic resistance, their role in the environment is now an increasing focus of attention. The aim of this review is to provide an in-depth analysis of recent studies of antibiotic-resistance integrons in the environment, highlighting their potential involvement in antibiotic-resistance outside the clinical context. We will focus particularly on the impact of human activities (agriculture, industries, wastewater treatment, etc.).},

Hospitals are the major antibiotic consumers and thus facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance. Questions are increasingly being raised about the management of hospital effluents, but their involvement in antibiotic-resistance dissemination has never been assessed. Integrons are a paradigm of genetic transfer between the environmental resistome and both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. In order to assess the impact of hospital activities on antibiotic-resistance dissemination in the environment, we monitored integrons and their gene cassettes in hospital effluents, and their release in the environment. We found that bacterial communities present in a hospital effluent contained a high proportion of integrons. In terms of both their gene cassette diversity and gene cassette arrays, the urban effluent and municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent were most similar, whereas the hospital effluent and recirculation sludge exhibited very specific patterns. We found that anthropogenic activities led to the release of abundant integrons and antibiotic-resistance gene cassettes, but we observed no specific impact of hospital activities on the receiving environment. Furthermore, although the WWTP did not reduce the normalized integron copy number, it reduced the diversity of gene cassette arrays contained in the raw wastewater, underlining the effect of the biological treatment on the anthropogenic integron pool arriving at the WWTP.},

 abstract = {The rapid spread of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens is a serious human health threat. While a range of environments have been identified as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), we lack understanding of the origins of these ARGs and their spread from environment to clinic. This is partly due to our inability to identify the natural bacterial hosts of ARGs and the mobile genetic elements that mediate this spread, such as plasmids and integrons. Here we demonstrate that the in vivo proximity-ligation method Hi-C can reconstruct a known plasmid-host association from a wastewater community, and identify the in situ host range of ARGs, plasmids, and integrons by physically linking them to their host chromosomes. Hi-C detected both previously known and novel associations between ARGs, mobile genetic elements and host genomes, thus validating this method. We showed that IncQ plasmids and class 1 integrons had the broadest host range in this wastewater, and identified bacteria belonging to Moraxellaceae, Bacteroides, and Prevotella, and especially Aeromonadaceae as the most likely reservoirs of ARGs in this community. A better identification of the natural carriers of ARGs will aid the development of strategies to limit resistance spread to pathogens.},

This study determined the minimal selective concentrations (MSCs) for macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics included on the European Commission's Water Framework Directive's priority hazardous substances~Watch List. The macrolides demonstrated positive selection for ermF at concentrations 1-2 orders of magnitude greater ({\textgreater}500 and {\textless}750 µg/L) than measured environmental concentrations (MECs). Ciprofloxacin illustrated positive selection for intI1 at concentrations similar to current MECs ({\textgreater}7.8 and {\textless}15.6 µg/L). This highlights the need for compound specific assessment of selective potential. In addition, a sub-MSC selective window defined by the minimal increased persistence concentration (MIPC) is described. Differential rates of negative selection (or persistence) were associated with elevated prevalence relative to the no antibiotic control below the MSC. This increased persistence leads to opportunities for further selection over time and risk of human exposure and environmental transmission.},

 abstract = {Background

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a public health crisis that is predicted to cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050. The environment has been implicated as a reservoir of AMR and is suggested to play a role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Currently, most research has focused on measuring concentrations of antibiotics and characterising the abundance and diversity of ARGs and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in the environment. To date, there has been limited empirical research on whether humans are exposed to this, and whether exposure can lead to measureable impacts on human health. Therefore, the objective of this work is to produce two linked systematic maps to investigate previous~research on exposure and transmission of AMR to humans from the environment. The first map will investigate the available research relating to exposure and transmission of ARB/ARGs from the environment to humans on a global scale and the second will investigate the prevalence of ARB/ARGs in various environments in the UK. These two maps will be useful for policy makers and research funders to identify where there are significant gluts and gaps in the current research, and where more primary and synthesis research needs to be undertaken.

Methods

Separate search strategies will be developed for the two maps. Searches will be run in 13 databases, and grey literature will be sought from key websites and engagement with experts. Hits will be managed in EndNote and screened in two stages (title/abstract then full text) against predefined inclusion criteria. A minimum of 10{\%} will be double screened with ongoing consistency checking. All included studies will have data extracted into a bespoke form designed and piloted for each map. Data to be extracted will include bibliographic details, study design, location, exposure source, exposure route, health outcome (Map~1); and prevalence/percentage of ARB/ARG (Map~2). No validity appraisal will be undertaken. Results will be tabulated and presented narratively, together with graphics showing the types and areas of research that has been undertaken and heatmaps for key exposure-health outcomes (Map~1) and exposure-prevalence (Map~2).},

Methicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, acts by inhibiting penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that are involved in the synthesis of peptidoglycan, an essential mesh-like polymer that surrounds the cell. S. aureus can become resistant to methicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics through the expression of a foreign PBP, PBP2a, that is resistant to the action of methicillin but which can perform the functions of the host PBPs. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates are often resistant to other classes of antibiotics (through different mechanisms) making treatment options limited, and this has led to the search for new compounds active against these strains. An understanding of the mechanism of methicillin resistance has led to the discovery of accessory factors that influence the level and nature of methicillin resistance. Accessory factors, such as Fem factors, provide possible new targets, while compounds that modulate methicillin resistance such as epicatechin gallate, derived from green tea, and corilagin, provide possible lead compounds for development of inhibitors.},

The presence of multiple copies of this gene makes the community abundance data distorted and gene copy normalization (GCN) necessary for correction. Even though GCN of 16S data provided a picture closer to the metagenome before, it should also be compared with communities of known composition due to the fact that library preparation is prone to methodological biases. Here, we process 16S rRNA gene amplicon data from eleven simple mock communities with DADA2 and estimate the impact of GCN. In all cases, the mock community composition derived from the 16S sequencing differs from those expected, and GCN fails to improve the classification for most of the analysed communities. Our approach provides empirical evidence that GCN does not improve the 16S target sequencing analyses in real scenarios. We therefore question the use of GCN for metataxonomic surveys until a more comprehensive catalogue of copy numbers becomes available.},

MIC values were determined by a microdilution procedure in IsoSensitest broth according to the German standard (DIN). All Klebsiella spp. were naturally resistant or intermediate to amoxicillin, ticarcillin and to antibiotics to which other Enterobacteriaceae are also intrinsically resistant. Klebsiella spp. were naturally sensitive or intermediate to several penicillins, all tested cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolones, tetracyclines, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, chloramphenicol and nitrofurantoin. K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae and subsp. rhinoscleromatis strains were generally more susceptible to antibiotics than strains of other Klebsiella taxa. K pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis was the most susceptible taxon, being highly susceptible to cefuroxime, anti-folates and naturally intermediate to erythromycin and clarithromycin. K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae was most susceptible to glycopeptides. K. oxytoca and K. terrigena strains were least susceptible to cefazoline, cefoperazone and fosfomycin, respectively. The results of the present study describe a database of the natural antimicrobial susceptibility of Klebsiella spp., which can be used for the validation of antibiotic susceptibility results of these bacteria. MIC patterns to beta-lactams indicate the expression of chromosomally encoded class A gamma-lactamases in all the species, including the subspecies of K. pneumoniae. Similar natural susceptibility patterns of K. planticola and K. ornithinolytica to all tested antibiotics support the status of K. ornithinolytica as a biovar of K. planticola.},

 abstract = {The vast majority of bacteria in the environment have yet to be cultured. Consequently, a major proportion of both genetic diversity within known gene families and an unknown number of novel gene families reside in these uncultured organisms. Isolation of these genes is limited by lack of sequence information. Where such sequence data exist, PCR directed at conserved sequence motifs recovers only partial genes. Here we outline a strategy for recovering complete open reading frames from environmental DNA samples. PCR assays were designed to target the 59-base element family of recombination sites that flank gene cassettes associated with integrons. Using such assays, diverse gene cassettes could be amplified from the vast majority of environmental DNA samples tested. These gene cassettes contained complete open reading frames, the majority of which were associated with ribosome binding sites. Novel genes with clear homologies to phosphotransferase, DNA glycosylase, methyl transferase, and thiotransferase genes were identified. However, the majority of amplified gene cassettes contained open reading frames with no identifiable homologues in databases. Accumulation analysis of the gene cassettes amplified from soil samples showed no signs of saturation, and soil samples taken at 1-m intervals along transects demonstrated different amplification profiles. Taken together, the genetic novelty, steep accumulation curves, and spatial heterogeneity of genes recovered show that this method taps into a vast pool of unexploited genetic diversity. The success of this approach indicates that mobile gene cassettes and, by inference, integrons are widespread in natural environments and are likely to contribute significantly to bacterial diversity.},

Moreover, the relative abundance of ARGs in the phage DNA fraction (0.26{\%}) was higher than in the bacterial DNA fraction (0.18{\%}). These differences were particularly evident for genes encoding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) proteins, phosphotransferases, \textgreek{b}-lactamases and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance. Analysis of assembled contigs also revealed that blaOXA-10, blaOXA-58 and blaOXA-24 genes belonging to class D \textgreek{b}-lactamases as well as a novel blaTEM (98.9{\%} sequence similarity to the blaTEM-1 gene) belonging to class A \textgreek{b}-lactamases were detected in a higher proportion in phage DNA.

 abstract = {We examined the ability of composting to remove ARGs and enteric bacteria in litter obtained from broiler chickens fed with a diet supplemented with Bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BDM) (conventional chicken litter), or an antibiotic-free diet (raised without antibiotic (RWA) chicken litter). This was done by evaluating the litter before and after composting for the abundance of ten gene targets associated with antibiotic resistance or horizontal gene transfer, the composition of the bacterial communities, and the abundance of viable enteric bacteria. The abundance of gene targets was determined by qPCR and the microbial community composition of chicken litter determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Enteric bacteria were enumerated by viable plate count. A majority of the gene targets were more abundant in conventional than in RWA litter. In both litter types, the absolute abundance of all of the target genes decreased after composting except sul1, intI1, incW and erm(F) that remained stable. Composting significantly reduced the abundance of enteric bacteria, including those carrying antibiotic resistance. The major difference in bacterial community composition between conventional and RWA litter was due to members affiliated to the genus Pseudomonas, which were 28{\%} more abundant in conventional than in RWA litter. Composting favoured the presence of thermophilic bacteria, such as those affiliated with the genus Truepera, but decreased the abundance of those bacterial genera associated with cold-adapted species, such as Carnobacterium, Psychrobacter and Oceanisphaera. The present study shows that chicken litter from broilers fed with a diet supplemented with antibiotic has an increased abundance of some ARGs, even after composting. However, we can conclude that fertilization with composted litter represents a reduced risk of transmission of antibiotic resistance genes and enteric bacteria of poultry origin to soil and crops than will fertilization with raw litter.},

 abstract = {Antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) are a major concern to public health worldwide. While antibiotics have been naturally produced by environmental bacteria for millions of years, modern widespread use of antibiotics has enriched resistance mechanisms in human-impacted bacterial environments. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) continue to emerge and spread rapidly. To combat the global threat of antibiotic resistance, researchers must develop methods to rapidly characterize AROs and ARGs, monitor their spread across space and time, and identify novel ARGs and resistance pathways. We review how high-throughput sequencing-based methods can be combined with classic culture-based assays to characterize, monitor, and track AROs and ARGs. Then, we evaluate genomic and metagenomic methods for identifying ARGs and biosynthetic pathways for novel antibiotics from genomic data sets. Together, these genomic analyses can improve surveillance and prediction of emerging resistance threats and accelerate the development of new antibiotic therapies to combat resistance.},

 abstract = {Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in fertilizers pose risks to human health and their variation in soil after fertilization has been reported. However, some important questions, such as the origin of ARG and ARB observed in soil following fertilization, which are present in soil regardless of fertilizer type (i.e., core (shared) ARGs and ARB), and the contribution of various ARG subtypes to the soil antibiotic resistome, need to be addressed. In this study, the effects of a long-term (9-year) application of organic (manure) and inorganic (chemistry) fertilizers on ARGs in greenhouse soils growing vegetables were investigated using metagenomic sequencing. The results showed that both organic and inorganic fertilizers application increased the diversity and abundance of soil ARGs. The dominant ARG types in organic fertilizer (OF) were different from that in organic fertilizer treated soil (SO), inorganic fertilizer treated soil (SI) and no fertilizer control plots (SC). The difference of core ARGs abundance reflected the variation of ARG profiles among SC, SI and SO. The OF is likely a source of the elevated ARG subtypes in soil and almost all the soil core ARG subtypes can be detected in organic fertilizer. Fifteen ARG types were enriched in the soil with OF, and some ARG subtypes such as sul1, sul2, tetX and tetL might derived from OF while others including as vanR, tcmA, rosB, and mexF might be from indigenous microbes in soil. The nutrition factors were found to influence the ARG profiles in fertilized soil. In summary, this study revealed the possible reason for the soil total ARG numbers and their relative abundance increase after fertilization, which will facilitate the control of ARGs and ARB dissemination.},

Here we study the impact of confined and controlled swine farm environments on temporal changes in the gut microbiome and resistome of veterinary students with occupational exposure for 3 months. By analyzing 16S rRNA and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing data in tandem with culture-based methods, we show that farm exposure shapes the gut microbiome of students, resulting in enrichment of potentially pathogenic taxa and antimicrobial resistance genes. Comparison of students' gut microbiomes and resistomes to farm workers' and environmental samples revealed extensive sharing of resistance genes and bacteria following exposure and after three months of their visit. Notably, antibiotic resistance genes were found in similar genetic contexts in student samples and farm environmental samples. Dynamic Bayesian network modeling predicted that the observed changes partially reverse over a 4-6 month period. Our results indicate that acute changes in a human's living environment can persistently shape their gut microbiota and antibiotic resistome.},

The applicability of compositional data analysis methods has been hampered by the availability of software and the difﬁculty in interpreting their results. This work is focused on three methods for variable selection that acknowledge the compositional structure of microbiome data: selbal, a forward selection approach for the identiﬁcation of compositional balances, and clr-lasso and codalasso, two penalized regression models for compositional data analysis. This study highlights the link between these methods and brings out some limitations of the centered log-ratio transformation for variable selection. In particular, the fact that it is not subcompositionally consistent makes the microbial signatures obtained from clr-lasso not readily transferable. Coda-lasso is computationally efﬁcient and suitable when the focus is the identiﬁcation of the most associated microbial taxa. Selbal stands out when the goal is to obtain a parsimonious model with optimal prediction performance, but it is computationally greedy. We provide a reproducible vignette for the application of these methods that will enable researchers to fully leverage their potential in microbiome studies.},

 abstract = {Background

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health threat that requires a {\textquotedbl}One Health{\textquotedbl} approach. Of the One Health triad, the environmental component is the most dynamic and most neglected. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to assess and analyze global research activity on AMR in the environment.

Methods

This was a bibliometric descriptive study of publications on AMR in the environment. Publications were retrieved using SciVerse Scopus for the study period from 2000 to 2019. The search query was developed using terms and phrases related to the topic. The retrieved publications were analyzed for specific bibliometric indicators including annual growth, citation analysis, key players, research output for each world regions, research themes, and occurrences of different drug classes of antimicrobials. Visualization maps including research collaboration were created using VOSviewer program. The Hirsch (h) index was used to assess scientific impact.

Results

There were 2611 research articles based on the implemented research query. The retrieved documents had an average of 22 citations per document and an h-index of 122. The annual number of publications showed a steep increase from 2011 to 2019. The major research themes in the field were (1) dissemination and abundance of antibiotic-resistant genes and (2) detection of bacterial strains or antibiotic residues in various environmental isolates. The bulk of the retrieved articles (n = 899; 34.4{\%}) originated from the European region. China led with 598 (22.9{\%}) documents. Four of the top 10 active institutions were in China. The top 10 active countries had relatively inadequate international research collaboration. The most commonly encountered antibiotic drug classes in the retrieved articles were penicillin/cephalosporin (n = 1152 occurrences). The most frequently encountered pathogen in the retrieved publications was E. coli (n = 666). The Science of the Total Environment journal was the most prolific journal with 139 (5.3{\%}) publications.

Conclusion

Scientific literature on the AMR in the environment has witnessed a steep growth lately with a leading role of China and Chinese institutions. Data on AMR in the environment need to be collected from all world regions including the Eastern Mediterranean and African regions through research collaboration and funding of research in this field.},

However, the structural basis that defines the variable induction level remains unknown. Here, we reveal that the conformational equilibrium between the repressive and inducive conformations in QacR defines the induction level of the transporter gene. In addition, the unligated QacR is already partly populated in the inducive conformation, allowing the basal expression of the transporter. We also showed that, in the known constitutively active QacR mutants, the equilibrium is shifted more toward the inducive conformation, even in the unligated state. These results highlight the unexpected structural mechanism, connecting the promiscuous multidrug binding to the variable transcriptional regulation of QacR, which provide clues to dysfunctioning of the multidrug resistance systems.},

However, the influence of salt accumulation on the distribution profile of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile gene elements (MGEs) remains unclear. In this study, we sampled a wild saline soil where the salt accumulation was frequently observed to investigate the vertical distribution profiles of ARGs and MGEs. The results showed that an increasing gradient of ARGs and MGEs was observed from the top to deep layer with the decreasing of electrical conductivity (EC1:5 values) indicating the salt-influenced attenuation of ARGs in the saline soil. The competing test suggested that the attenuation of ARGs in response to salinity gradient was attributable to the elimination of the ARG-harboring plasmids, due to the reduction of the relative fitness of plasmid-harboring strains. Additionally, the network analyses showed that the attenuation of ARGs might be associated with decreased abundance of Actinobacteria. Overall, this study identifies that salinity as an abiotic stress could re-shape the distribution of ARGs, which may influence the dissemination of ARGs in the environment.},

Long-term exposure to BACs reduced community diversity and resulted in the enrichment of BAC-resistant species, predominantly Pseudomonas species. Exposure of the two microbial communities to BACs significantly decreased their susceptibility to BACs as well as three clinically relevant antibiotics (penicillin G, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin). Increased resistance to BACs and penicillin G of the two BACs-exposed communities is predominantly attributed to degradation or transformation of these compounds, whereas resistance to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin is largely due to the activity of efflux pumps. Quantification of several key multidrug resistance genes showed a much higher number of copies of these genes in the DPB and B microbial communities compared to the DP community. Collectively, our findings indicate that exposure of a microbial community to BACs results in increased antibiotic resistance, which has important implications for both human and environmental health.},

Anaerobic digestion is a conventional technique for livestock manure/wastewater treatment. However, the factors affecting arsenic volatilization are poorly understood in arylarsenic-loaded anaerobic reactors. The main factors such as ROX loading, exposure time of anaerobic granular sludge (AGS) to ROX, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) levels, affecting arsenic volatilization were investigated in this study. The results indicated that ROX loading of 5.70~mg-As·L-1 triggered the maximum volatile arsenic yield of 6.78~ng-As·g-1-VSS·d-1, which was 4.95 times higher compared to the ROX-free assay. The conversion of ROX into inorganic arsenic was an essential step for arsenic volatilization. The 160-day and 270-day exposure of AGS to ROX caused 6-fold and 8-fold increase in volatile arsenic yield, respectively, compared to the 0-day exposure. With the longer-time exposure to ROX, AGS provided more available arsenic for volatilization and its arsenic-volatilizing capacity was significantly enhanced. VFA level was positively associated with arsenic volatilization (r~=~0.832-0.950; p~{\textless}~0.05). The abundance of arsM genes in AGS increased by 34.62-129.05{\%} after the 100-day incubation, and was strongly correlated to arsenic volatilization. Based on these results, possible pathway of arsenic volatilization in ROX-loaded digesters were proposed. The result from this study improves a better understanding of the potential of arsenic volatilization in arylarsenic-contaminated environments.},

P. aeruginosa S-6 grown for 36 and 48 h on agar with 10 micrograms of EM per ml (1/10th the MIC) showed significantly increased sensitivity to human serum bactericidal activity compared with those of bacteria grown on agar without EM (P {\textless} 0.05). No changes in serum sensitivity were observed in bacteria grown for less than 24 h. This increased sensitivity was apparent even at a concentration of 1.5 micrograms of EM per ml (1/67th the MIC) in bacteria grown for 48 h (P {\textless} 0.01). Among the other macrolide antibiotics tested, clarithromycin also enhanced sensitivity to serum, but there were no changes in the sensitivities of bacteria grown on agar with kitasamycin, josamycin, rokitamycin, or oleandomycin even at a concentration of 12 micrograms/ml (1/16th, 1/16th, 1/8th, and 1/33rd the MICs, respectively). P. aeruginosa S-6 grown on agar with subinhibitory concentrations of EM showed decreased cell surface hydrophobicity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas oleandomycin and rokitamycin, even at a concentration of 12 micrograms/ml, induced a slight decrease in hydrophobicity which was approximately equivalent to that of 1.5 micrograms of EM per ml. Among six other strains of the nonmucoid phenotype, three strains became more sensitive to serum by exposure to 10 micrograms of EM per ml for 48 h. In contrast, no evident correlation between EM treatment and a change in serum sensitivity was observed in six strains of the mucoid phenotype, as judged by the results of experiments with both 2 and 0.4{\%} serum. These results show that EM at subinhibitory concentrations enhances the serum sensitivity of some P. aeruginosa strains. Since induced serum sensitivity was accompanied by a decrease in bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity, EM may render P. aeruginosa more serum sensitive by changing the cell surface structure(s) of this organism.},

In particular, with the fast accumulation of transcriptomic data of non-model species and metagenomic data, profile homology search is widely adopted in integrated pipelines for functional analysis. While the state-of-the-art tool HMMER has achieved high sensitivity and accuracy in domain annotation, the sensitivity of HMMER on short reads declines rapidly. The low sensitivity on short read homology search can lead to inaccurate domain composition and abundance computation. Our experimental results showed that half of the reads were missed by HMMER for a RNA-Seq dataset. Thus, there is a need for better methods to improve the homology search performance for short reads.

RESULTS

We introduce a profile homology search tool named Short-Pair that is designed for short paired-end reads. By using an approximate Bayesian approach employing distribution of fragment lengths and alignment scores, Short-Pair can retrieve the missing end and determine true domains. In particular, Short-Pair increases the accuracy in aligning short reads that are part of remote homologs. We applied Short-Pair to a RNA-Seq dataset and a metagenomic dataset and quantified its sensitivity and accuracy on homology search. The experimental results show that Short-Pair can achieve better overall performance than the state-of-the-art methodology of profile homology search.

CONCLUSIONS

Short-Pair is best used for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data that lack reference genomes. It provides a complementary paired-end read homology search tool to HMMER. The source code is freely available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/short-pair/ .},

@article{Tenover.2006,
 abstract = {The treatment of bacterial infections is increasingly complicated by the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial agents are often categorized according to their principal mechanism of action. Mechanisms include interference with cell wall synthesis (e.g., beta-lactams and glycopeptide agents), inhibition of protein synthesis (macrolides and tetracyclines), interference with nucleic acid synthesis (fluoroquinolones and rifampin), inhibition of a metabolic pathway (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and disruption of bacterial membrane structure (polymyxins and daptomycin). Bacteria may be intrinsically resistant to {\textgreater} or =1 class of antimicrobial agents, or may acquire resistance by de novo mutation or via the acquisition of resistance genes from other organisms. Acquired resistance genes may enable a bacterium to produce enzymes that destroy the antibacterial drug, to express efflux systems that prevent the drug from reaching its intracellular target, to modify the drug's target site, or to produce an alternative metabolic pathway that bypasses the action of the drug. Acquisition of new genetic material by antimicrobial-susceptible bacteria from resistant strains of bacteria may occur through conjugation, transformation, or transduction, with transposons often facilitating the incorporation of the multiple resistance genes into the host's genome or plasmids. Use of antibacterial agents creates selective pressure for the emergence of resistant strains. Herein 3 case histories-one involving Escherichia coli resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, another focusing on the emergence of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and a third detailing multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa--are reviewed to illustrate the varied ways in which resistant bacteria develop.},

While myriad variants on NGS techniques and bioinformatic pipelines are available, our results point to core differences that have not been highlighted in any studies to date. Given the low number of taxa identified when coupling shotgun data with clade-based taxonomic algorithms, previous studies that quantified biodiversity using such bioinformatic tools should be viewed cautiously or re-analyzed. Nonetheless, shotgun has complementary advantages that should be weighed when designing projects.},

Those consequences will multiply if collaborative global action is not taken to address the spread of resistance. Major drivers of antimicrobial resistance in humans have been accelerated by inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing in health care practices; the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in livestock; and the promulgation of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment. To explore the issue of antimicrobial resistance, the Forum of Microbial Threats planned a public workshop. Participants explored issues of antimicrobial resistance through the lens of One Health, which is a collaborative approach of multiple disciplines---working locally, nationally, and globally---for strengthening systems to counter infectious diseases and related issues that threaten human, animal, and environmental health, with an end point of improving global health and achieving gains in development. They also discussed immediate and short-term actions and research needs that will have the greatest effect on reducing antimicrobial resistance, while taking into account the complexities of bridging different sectors and disciplines to address this global threat.

Although some current compounds in the pipeline have exhibited increased susceptibility rates in surveillance studies that depend on geography, pre-existing cross-resistance both within and across antibacterial classes limits the activity of many of the new agents against the most extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pan-drug-resistant (PDR) Gram-negative pathogens. In~particular, cross-resistance to unrelated classes may occur by co-selection of resistant strains, thus leading to the rapid emergence and subsequent spread of resistance. There is a continued need for innovation and new-class antibacterial agents in order to provide effective therapeutic options against infections specifically caused by XDR and PDR Gram-negative bacteria.},

The preclinical pipeline is characterized by high levels of diversity and interesting scientific concepts, with 135 projects on direct-acting small molecules that represent new classes, new targets or new mechanisms of action. There is also a strong trend towards non-traditional approaches, including diverse antivirulence approaches, microbiome-modifying strategies, and engineered phages and probiotics. The high number of pathogen-specific and adjunctive approaches is unprecedented in antibiotic history. Translational hurdles are not adequately addressed yet, especially development pathways to show clinical impact of non-traditional approaches.

Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rDNA sequencing with the help of classical biochemical identification indicated the existence of 2 major phyla, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Antimicrobial activity analysis combined with the results of amplifying genes encoding for polyketide synthetase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase showed that seaweed-associated bacteria had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. These epibionts might be beneficial to seaweeds by limiting or preventing the development of competing or fouling bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of ketosynthase (KS) regions with respect to the diverse range of KS domains showed that the KS domains from the candidate isolates were of Type I. The bacterial cultures retained their antimicrobial activities after plasmid curing, which further suggested that the antimicrobial activity of these isolates was not encoded by plasmid, and the genes encoding the antimicrobial product might be present within the genome. Seaweed-associated bacteria with potential antimicrobial activity suggested that the seaweed species are an ideal ecological niche harboring specific bacterial diversity representing a largely underexplored source of antimicrobial secondary metabolites.},

However, intensive animal production relies on the regular use of antimicrobials to maintain health and productivity on farms. The routine use of antimicrobials fuels the development of antimicrobial resistance, a growing threat for the health of humans and animals. Monitoring global trends in antimicrobial use is essential to track progress associated with antimicrobial stewardship efforts across regions. We collected antimicrobial sales data for chicken, cattle, and pig systems in 41 countries in 2017 and projected global antimicrobial consumption from 2017 to 2030. We used multivariate regression models and estimated global antimicrobial sales in 2017 at 93,309 tonnes (95{\%} CI: 64,443, 149,886). Globally, sales are expected to rise by 11.5{\%} in 2030 to 104,079 tonnes (95{\%} CI: 69,062, 172,711). All continents are expected to increase their antimicrobial use. Our results show lower global antimicrobial sales in 2030 compared to previous estimates, owing to recent reports of decrease in antimicrobial use, in particular in China, the world's largest consumer. Countries exporting a large proportion of their production are more likely to report their antimicrobial sales data than countries with small export markets.},

 abstract = {Atrazine, a herbicide widely used in corn production, is a frequently detected groundwater contaminant. Fourteen bacterial strains able to use this herbicide as a sole source of nitrogen were isolated from soils obtained from two farms in Canada and two farms in France. These strains were indistinguishable from each other based on repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR genomic fingerprinting performed with primers ERIC1R, ERIC2, and BOXA1R. Based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis of one representative isolate, strain C147, the isolates belong to the genus Pseudaminobacter in the family Rhizobiaceae. Strain C147 did not form nodules on the legumes alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), and soybean (Glycine max L.). A number of chloro-substituted s-triazine herbicides were degraded, but methylthio-substituted s-triazine herbicides were not degraded. Based on metabolite identification data, the fact that oxygen was not required, and hybridization of genomic DNA to the atzABC genes, atrazine degradation occurred via a series of hydrolytic reactions initiated by dechlorination and followed by dealkylation. Most strains could mineralize [ring-U-(14)C]atrazine, and those that could not mineralize atrazine lacked atzB or atzBC. The atzABC genes, which were plasmid borne in every atrazine-degrading isolate examined, were unstable and were not always clustered together on the same plasmid. Loss of atzB was accompanied by loss of a copy of IS1071. Our results indicate that an atrazine-degrading Pseudaminobacter sp. with remarkably little diversity is widely distributed in agricultural soils and that genes of the atrazine degradation pathway carried by independent isolates of this organism are not clustered, can be independently lost, and may be associated with a catabolic transposon. We propose that the widespread distribution of the atrazine-degrading Pseudaminobacter sp. in agricultural soils exposed to atrazine is due to the characteristic ability of this organism to utilize alkylamines, and therefore atrazine, as sole sources of carbon when the atzABC genes are acquired.},

During the first 6 yr (1999-2004) soils were treated at concentrations of 0, 0.01 0.1, and 1.0 mg kg soil, in subsequent years at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 mg kg soil. The lower end of this concentration range is within that which would result from an annual application of manure from medicated swine. Following ten annual applications, the fate of the drugs in the soil was evaluated. Residues of SMZ and TYL, but not CTC were removed much more rapidly in soil with a history of exposure to 10 mg/kg drugs than in untreated control soil. Residues of C-SMZ were rapidly and thoroughly mineralized to CO in the historically treated soils, but not in the untreated soil. A SMZ-degrading sp. was isolated from the treated soil. Overall, these results indicate that soil bacteria adapt to long-term exposure to some veterinary antibiotics resulting in sharply reduced persistence. Accelerated biodegradation of antibiotics in matrices exposed to agricultural, wastewater, or pharmaceutical manufacturing effluents would attenuate environmental exposure to antibiotics, and merits investigation in the context of assessing potential risks of antibiotic resistance development in environmental matrices.},

In the present study, a series of replicated field plots were left untreated or received up to five annual spring applications of a mixture of three drugs to achieve a nominal concentration for each of 10 or 0.1mgkg(-1) soil; the latter an environmentally relevant concentration. Soil samples were incubated in the laboratory, and supplemented with antibiotics to establish the dissipation kinetics of erythromycin and clarithromycin using radioisotope methods, and azithromycin using HPLC-MS/MS. All three drugs were dissipated significantly more rapidly in soils with a history of field exposure to 10mgkg(-1) macrolides, and erythromycin and clarithromycin were also degraded more rapidly in field soil exposed to 0.1mgkg(-1) macrolides. Rapid mineralization of (14)C-labelled erythromycin and clarithromycin are consistent with biodegradation. Analysis of field soils revealed no carryover of parent compound from year to year. Azithromycin transformation products were detected consistent with removal of the desosamine and cladinose moieties. Overall, these results have revealed that following several years of exposure to macrolide antibiotics these are amenable to accelerated degradation. The potential accelerated degradation of these drugs in soils amended with manure and sewage sludge should be investigated as this phenomenon would attenuate environmental exposure and selection pressure for clinically relevant resistance.},

 abstract = {A key strategy for attenuating the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is ensuring judicious use of antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine and in agriculture. Research on AMR in agriculture includes risk assessment, risk management, and identifying the role of agricultural practices in development of AMR. Risk assessment includes an impact assessment of antimicrobial use in livestock and on the environment; for example, many antimicrobials are excreted unchanged and thus reach the environment through manure application. This creates the potential for AMR transmission through the food processing chain and into agro-ecosystems receiving the agricultural waste. Risk management includes the assessment of cost-effective methods to keep animals healthy without the need for antimicrobial use, such as the use of vaccines, nutritional supplements and pre-, pro- or synbiotics and of waste management strategies to avoid AMR transmission. Currently, there is an important gap in understanding the degree of human exposure to AMR that is generated through agriculture, the burden of illness of AMR pathogens in human populations and the relationship between exposure and burden of illness. It is important that research on the agricultural, environmental and human medicine dimensions of AMR not be undertaken in silos, which is why the United Nations and countries around the world are working together within the One Health Framework that considers the inter-relatedness of humans, animals and the environment.},

To study such gradual evolution, we developed a selection device, the 'morbidostat', that continuously monitors bacterial growth and dynamically regulates drug concentrations, such that the evolving population is constantly challenged. We analyzed the evolution of resistance in Escherichia coli under selection with single drugs, including chloramphenicol, doxycycline and trimethoprim. Over a period of $\sim$20 days, resistance levels increased dramatically, with parallel populations showing similar phenotypic trajectories. Whole-genome sequencing of the evolved strains identified mutations both specific to resistance to a particular drug and shared in resistance to multiple drugs. Chloramphenicol and doxycycline resistance evolved smoothly through diverse combinations of mutations in genes involved in translation, transcription and transport. In contrast, trimethoprim resistance evolved in a stepwise manner, through mutations restricted to the gene encoding the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Sequencing of DHFR over the time course of the experiment showed that parallel populations evolved similar mutations and acquired them in a similar order.},

Samples of raw and digested manure were obtained from six commercial dairy farms in Ontario, Canada. Digestion significantly abated populations of viable coliforms in all six farms. Conjugative transfer of plasmids carrying \textgreek{b}-lactamase genes from manure bacteria enriched overnight with buffered peptone containing 4 mg/l cefotaxime into a \textgreek{b}-lactam sensitive gfp-labelled E. coli as a recipient strain was evaluated in patch matings. Digestion significantly decreased the frequency of the horizontal transfer potential of ESBL genes. Twenty-five transconjugants were sequenced revealing six distinct plasmids with a size range of 40 - 180kb. A variety of ESBL genes were identified: blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-27, blaCTX-M-55, blaPER-1 The blaCTX-M-15 was the most prevalent ESBL gene detected on plasmids harboured by transconjugants. Various mobile genetic elements were found located proximal to resistance genes. Ten gene targets including sul1, strA, strB, ermB, ermF, intI1, aadA, incW, blaPSE and blaOXA-20 were quantified by quantitative PCR on a subset of 18 raw and 18 digested samples. Most targets were significantly more abundant in raw manure, however ermB and ermF targets were more abundant in digested samples. Overall, on-farm digestion of dairy manure abated coliform bacteria, a number of antibiotic resistance-associated gene targets, and the potential for in vitro conjugation of plasmids conferring resistance to extended-spectrum \textgreek{b}-lactams and other classes of antibiotics into E. coli CV601.IMPORTANCEUsing livestock manure for fertilization can entrain antibiotic resistant bacteria into soil. Manure on some dairy farms is anaerobically digested before being land applied. Recommending the widespread implementation of the practice should be founded on understanding the impact of this treatment on various endpoints of human health concern. Although lab-scale anaerobic treatments have showed potential of reducing antibiotic resistance genes, there are very few data from commercial farms. Anaerobic digestion of manure on six dairy farms efficiently abated coliform bacteria and E. coli and a majority of antibiotic resistance-associated gene targets. In addition, the conjugation potential of plasmids carrying ESBL genes into introduced E. coli CV601 was reduced. Overall, anaerobic digestion abated coliform bacteria, the genes that they carry and the potential for ESBL-carrying plasmid transfer.},

The protocols and methods used, however, vary considerably with regard to amplification primers, sequencing primers, sequencing technologies; as well as quality filtering and clustering. How results are affected by these choices, and whether data produced with different protocols can be meaningfully compared, is often unknown. Here we compare results obtained using three different amplification primer sets (targeting V4, V6-V8, and V7-V8) and two sequencing technologies (454 pyrosequencing and Illumina MiSeq) using DNA from a mock community containing a known number of species as well as complex environmental samples whose PCR-independent profiles were estimated using shotgun sequencing. We find that paired-end MiSeq reads produce higher quality data and enabled the use of more aggressive quality control parameters over 454, resulting in a higher retention rate of high quality reads for downstream data analysis. While primer choice considerably influences quantitative abundance estimations, sequencing platform has relatively minor effects when matched primers are used. Beta diversity metrics are surprisingly robust to both primer and sequencing platform biases.},

Statistical detection of co-occurring genes across genomes, known as {\textquotedbl}phylogenetic profiling{\textquotedbl}, is a powerful bioinformatic technique for inferring gene-gene functional associations. However, this can be a challenging task given the size and complexity of phylogenomic databases, difficulty in accounting for phylogenetic structure, inconsistencies in genome annotation, and substantial computational requirements.

RESULTS

We introduce PhyloCorrelate-a computational framework for gene co-occurrence analysis across large phylogenomic datasets. PhyloCorrelate implements a variety of co-occurrence metrics including standard correlation metrics and model-based metrics that account for phylogenetic history. By combining multiple metrics, we developed an optimized score that exhibits a superior ability to link genes with overlapping GO terms and KEGG pathways, enabling gene function prediction. Using genomic and functional annotation data from the Genome Taxonomy Database and AnnoTree, we performed all-by-all comparisons of gene occurrence profiles across the bacterial tree of life, totaling 154,217,052 comparisons for 28,315 genes across 27,372 bacterial genomes. All predictions are available in an online database, which instantaneously returns the top correlated genes for any PFAM, TIGRFAM, or KEGG query. In total, PhyloCorrelate detected 29,762 high confidence associations between bacterial gene/protein pairs, and generated functional predictions for 834 DUFs and proteins of unknown function.

AVAILABILITY

PhyloCorrelate is available as a web-server at phylocorrelate.uwaterloo.ca as well as an R package for analysis of custom datasets. We anticipate that PhyloCorrelate will be broadly useful as a tool for predicting function and interactions for gene families.

We developed a trait-based approach that: (i) assesses if a community trait clustering pattern is related to increasing environmental constraints along a gradient; and (ii) determines quantitative thresholds for an environmental variable along a gradient to interpret changes in prevailing community assembly drivers. We used a regional set of natural shallow saline ponds covering a wide salinity gradient (0.1-40{\%} w/v). We identify a consistent discrete salinity threshold (ca. 5{\%}) for microbial community assembly drivers. Above 5{\%} salinity a strong environmental filtering prevailed as an assembly force, whereas a combination of biotic and abiotic factors dominated at lower salinities.

 abstract = {The prevailing terminological confusion around the concept 'diversity' has hampered accurate communication and caused diversity issues to appear unnecessarily complicated. In fact, a consistent terminology for phenomena related to (species) diversity is already available. When this terminology is adhered to, diversity emerges as an easily understood concept. It is important to differentiate between diversity itself and a diversity index: an index of something is just a surrogate for the thing itself. The conceptual problem of defining diversity also has to be separated from the practical problem of deciding how to adequately quantify diversity for a community of interest. In practice, diversity can be quantified for any dataset where units of observation (such as individuals) have been classified into types (such as species). All that needs to be known is what proportion of the observed units belong to a type of mean abundance. Diversity equals the inverse of this mean, and it quantifies the effective number of the types of interest. In ecology, interest often (but not always) focuses on species diversity. If the dataset consists of (or gets divided into) subunits, then the total effective number of species (gamma diversity) can be partitioned into the effective number of compositionally distinct subunits (beta diversity) and the mean effective number of species per such subunit (alpha diversity). Species richness is related to species diversity, but they are not the same thing; richness does not take the proportional abundances into account and is therefore the actual-rather than the effective-number of types. Most of the phenomena that have been called 'beta diversity' in the past do not quantify an effective number of types, so they should be referred to by names other than 'diversity' (for example, species turnover or differentiation).},

However, the influence of light on the physiology and pathogenicity of human bacterial pathogens at temperatures found in warm-blooded hosts is still poorly understand. In this work, we show that Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ESKAPE) priority pathogens, which have been recognized by the WHO and the CDC as critical, can also sense and respond to light at temperatures found in human hosts. Most interestingly, in these pathogens, light modulates important pathogenicity determinants as well as virulence in an epithelial infection model, which could have implications in human infections. In fact, we found that alpha-toxin-dependent hemolysis, motility, and growth under iron-deprived conditions are modulated by light in S. aureus Light also regulates persistence, metabolism, and the ability to kill competitors in some of these microorganisms. Finally, light exerts a profound effect on the virulence of these pathogens in an epithelial infection model, although the response is not the same in the different species; virulence was enhanced by light in A. baumannii and S. aureus, while in A. nosocomialis and P. aeruginosa it was reduced. Neither the BlsA photoreceptor nor the type VI secretion system (T6SS) is involved in virulence modulation by light in A. baumannii Overall, this fundamental knowledge highlights the potential use of light to control pathogen virulence, either directly or by manipulating the light regulatory switch toward the lowest virulence/persistence configuration.IMPORTANCE Pathogenic bacteria are microorganisms capable of producing disease. Dangerous bacterial pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii, are responsible for serious intrahospital and community infections in humans. Therapeutics is often complicated due to resistance to multiple antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. In this work, we show that these pathogens sense natural light and respond to it by modulating aspects related to their ability to cause disease; in the presence of light, some of them become more aggressive, while others show an opposite response. Overall, we provide new understanding on the behavior of these pathogens, which could contribute to the control of infections caused by them. Since the response is distributed in diverse pathogens, this notion could prove a general concept.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of the MinION sequencer for bacterial genomic and metagenomic applications, with specific emphasis placed on the quality, yield, and accuracy of generated sequence data. Two independent laboratories at the National Microbiology Laboratory (Public Health Agency of Canada), sequenced a set of microbes in replicate, using the currently available flowcells, sequencing chemistries, and software available at the time of the experiment. Overall sequencing yield and quality improved through the course of this set of experiments. Sequencing alignment accuracy was high reaching 97{\%} for all 2D experiments, though was slightly lower for 1D sequencing (94{\%}). 1D sequencing provided much longer sequences than 2D. Both sequencing chemistries performed equally well in constructing genomic assemblies. There was evidence of barcode cross-over using both the native and PCR barcoding methods. Despite the sub-optimal nature of samples sequenced in the field, sequences attributable to B. anthracis the target organism used in this scenario, could none-the-less be detected. Together, this report showcases the rapid advancement in this technology and its utility in the context of genomic sequencing of microbial isolates of importance to public health.},

Total community RNA is random reversely transcribed into cDNA without any PCR or cloning step. Direct pyrosequencing produces large numbers of cDNA rRNA-tags; these are taxonomically profiled in a binning approach using the MEGAN software and two specifically compiled rRNA reference databases containing small and large subunit rRNA sequences. The pyrosequencing also produces mRNA-tags; these provide a sequence-based transcriptome of the community. One soil dataset of 258,411 RNA-tags of approximately 98 bp length contained 193,219 rRNA-tags with valid taxonomic information, together with 21,133 mRNA-tags. Quantitative information about the relative abundance of organisms from all three domains of life and from different trophic levels was obtained in a single experiment. Less frequent taxa, such as soil Crenarchaeota, were well represented in the data set. These were identified by more than 2,000 rRNA-tags; furthermore, their activity in situ was revealed through the presence of mRNA-tags specific for enzymes involved in ammonia oxidation and CO(2) fixation.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE

This approach could be widely applied in microbial ecology by efficiently linking community structure and function in a single experiment while avoiding biases inherent in other methods.},

 abstract = {The application of sewage sludge as soil amendment is a common agricultural practice. However, wastewater treatment plants, sewage sludge and sewage sludge-amended soils have been reported as hotspots for the appearance and dissemination of antibiotic resistance, driven, among other factors, by selection pressure exerted by co-exposure to antibiotics and heavy metals. To address this threat to environmental and human health, soil samples from a long-term (24 years) field experiment, carried out to study the impact of thermally dried and anaerobically digested sewage sludge (at different doses and frequencies of application) on agricultural soil quality, were investigated for the presence of genes encoding antibiotic resistance (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Sewage sludge-induced changes in specific soil physicochemical and microbial properties, as indicators of soil quality, were also investigated. The application of sewage sludge increased the total concentration of copper and zinc in amended soils, but without affecting the bioavailability of these metals, possibly due to the high values of soil pH and organic matter content. Soil microbal quality, as reflected by the value of the Soil Quality Index, was higher in sewage sludge-amended soils. Similarly, the application of sewage sludge increased soil microbial activity and biomass, as well as the abundance of ARGs and MGE genes, posing a risk of dissemination of antibiotic resistance. In contrast, the composition of soil prokaryotic communities was not significantly altered by the application of sewage sludge. We found correlation between soil Cu and Zn concentrations and the abundance of ARGs and MGE genes. It was concluded that sewage sludge-derived amendments must be properly treated and managed if they are to be applied to agricultural soil.},

The increased use of antimicrobials can have serious consequences on the environment. Antibiotics have had a reasonable role in bacterial co-infections with regards to the management of COVID-19. However, recent evidences suggest that there has been injudicious prescription of antimicrobials. Moreover, a large number of people are self-medicating with antibiotics in a misguided attempt to protect themselves from the virus. This practice is especially prevalent in developing communities. Although common soaps are effective at inactivating enveloped viruses, such as the SARS-CoV-2, use of antibacterial products bearing biocides has increased during this pandemic. Current wastewater treatment techniques are unable to offer complete elimination of antibacterial biocides. These compounds can then accumulate in different environmental compartments thus, disrupting the functioning of native microbes. These microbes are involved in the biogeochemical cycling of elements and environmental remediation. In addition, the presence of antimicrobial elements in the environment can stimulate antimicrobial resistance. Concrete actions are needed to address this issue. Development of an antimicrobial policy specific for COVID-19 is urgently needed. Investments into improving wastewater infrastructure as well as public awareness is crucial. Moreover, global monitoring programs and multidisciplinary collaborations are required to understand the environmental impact of this pandemics.},

The sensitization factors for three other hydrophobic antibiotics (rifampin, fusidic acid, and mupirocin) ranged from 16 to 300. The outer membrane permeability-increasing agents polymyxin B nonapeptide (3 micrograms/ml) and deacylpolymyxin B (1 microgram/ml) sensitized wild-type E. coli to azithromycin by factors of 10 and 30, respectively. Quantitatively very similar sensitization to the other macrolides took place. Polymyxin-resistant pmrA mutants of S. typhimurium displayed no cross-resistance to azithromycin. Proteus mirabilis mutants which were sensitized to polymyxin by a factor of {\textgreater} or = 300 to {\textgreater} or = 1,000 had a maximal two- to fourfold increase in sensitivity to azithromycin. These results indicate that azithromycin and the other new macrolides use the hydrophobic pathway across the outer membrane and that the intact outer membrane is an effective barrier against them. Furthermore, the results indicate that azithromycin, in contrast to polymyxin, does not effectively diffuse through the outer membrane by interacting electrostatically with the lipopolysaccharide.},

The consequences for the development of antimicrobial resistance in animals have received comparatively less attention than in humans. We analyzed 901 point prevalence surveys of pathogens in developing countries to map resistance in animals. China and India represented the largest hotspots of resistance, with new hotspots emerging in Brazil and Kenya. From 2000 to 2018, the proportion of antimicrobials showing resistance above 50{\%} increased from 0.15 to 0.41 in chickens and from 0.13 to 0.34 in pigs.

This is, for instance, shown by the emphasis on the protection of key drivers and ecosystem services as proposed in the protection goal options for soil organisms by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Such targets require insight into soil biodiversity, its role in the functioning of ecosystems, and the way it responds to stress. Also required are tools and methodologies for properly assessing biodiversity.

@article{vanGoethem.2018,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Soil bacteria naturally produce antibiotics as a competitive mechanism, with a concomitant evolution, and exchange by horizontal gene transfer, of a range of antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Surveys of bacterial resistance elements in edaphic systems have originated primarily from human-impacted environments, with relatively little information from remote and pristine environments, where the resistome may comprise the ancestral gene diversity.

METHODS

We used shotgun metagenomics to assess antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) distribution in 17 pristine and remote Antarctic surface soils within the undisturbed Mackay Glacier region. We also interrogated the phylogenetic placement of ARGs compared to environmental ARG sequences and tested for the presence of horizontal gene transfer elements flanking ARGs.

RESULTS

In total, 177 naturally occurring ARGs were identified, most of which encoded single or multi-drug efflux pumps. Resistance mechanisms for the inactivation of aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol and \textgreek{b}-lactam antibiotics were also common. Gram-negative bacteria harboured most ARGs (71{\%}), with fewer genes from Gram-positive Actinobacteria and Bacilli (Firmicutes) (9{\%}), reflecting the taxonomic composition of the soils. Strikingly, the abundance of ARGs per sample had a strong, negative correlation with species richness (r = - 0.49, P {\textless} 0.05). This result, coupled with a lack of mobile genetic elements flanking ARGs, suggests that these genes are ancient acquisitions of horizontal transfer events.

CONCLUSIONS

ARGs in these remote and uncontaminated soils most likely represent functional efficient historical genes that have since been vertically inherited over generations. The historical ARGs in these pristine environments carry a strong phylogenetic signal and form a monophyletic group relative to ARGs from other similar environments.},

This holds great scientific promise but has also led to an overwhelming number of methods and terms to describe infraspecific variation. This Review aims to clarify these advances by focusing on the diversity within bacterial and archaeal species in the context of microbiomics. We cover foundational microevolutionary concepts relevant to population genetics and summarize how within-species variation can be studied and stratified directly within microbial communities with a focus on metagenomics. Finally, we describe how common applications of within-species variation can be achieved using metagenomic data. We aim to guide the selection of appropriate terms and analytical approaches to facilitate researchers in benefiting from the increasing availability of large, high-resolution microbiome genetic sequencing data.},

 abstract = {Soil microbial diversity represents the largest global reservoir of novel microorganisms and enzymes. In this study, we coupled functional metagenomics and DNA stable-isotope probing (DNA-SIP) using multiple plant-derived carbon substrates and diverse soils to characterize active soil bacterial communities and their glycoside hydrolase genes, which have value for industrial applications. We incubated samples from three disparate Canadian soils (tundra, temperate rainforest, and agricultural) with five native carbon ((12)C) or stable-isotope-labeled ((13)C) carbohydrates (glucose, cellobiose, xylose, arabinose, and cellulose). Indicator species analysis revealed high specificity and fidelity for many uncultured and unclassified bacterial taxa in the heavy DNA for all soils and substrates. Among characterized taxa, Actinomycetales (Salinibacterium), Rhizobiales (Devosia), Rhodospirillales (Telmatospirillum), and Caulobacterales (Phenylobacterium and Asticcacaulis) were bacterial indicator species for the heavy substrates and soils tested. Both Actinomycetales and Caulobacterales (Phenylobacterium) were associated with metabolism of cellulose, and Alphaproteobacteria were associated with the metabolism of arabinose; members of the order Rhizobiales were strongly associated with the metabolism of xylose. Annotated metagenomic data suggested diverse glycoside hydrolase gene representation within the pooled heavy DNA. By screening 2,876 cloned fragments derived from the (13)C-labeled DNA isolated from soils incubated with cellulose, we demonstrate the power of combining DNA-SIP, multiple-displacement amplification (MDA), and functional metagenomics by efficiently isolating multiple clones with activity on carboxymethyl cellulose and fluorogenic proxy substrates for carbohydrate-active enzymes. Importance: The ability to identify genes based on function, instead of sequence homology, allows the discovery of genes that would not be identified through sequence alone. This is arguably the most powerful application of metagenomics for the recovery of novel genes and a natural partner of the stable-isotope-probing approach for targeting active-yet-uncultured microorganisms. We expanded on previous efforts to combine stable-isotope probing and metagenomics, enriching microorganisms from multiple soils that were active in degrading plant-derived carbohydrates, followed by construction of a cellulose-based metagenomic library and recovery of glycoside hydrolases through functional metagenomics. The major advance of our study was the discovery of active-yet-uncultivated soil microorganisms and enrichment of their glycoside hydrolases. We recovered positive cosmid clones in a higher frequency than would be expected with direct metagenomic analysis of soil DNA. This study has generated an invaluable metagenomic resource that future research will exploit for genetic and enzymatic potential.},

We performed a systematic comparison of several sampling and DNA isolation kits, quantified their effect on bacterial gDNA quality and the bacterial composition estimates at all taxonomic levels. Sixteen volunteers tested three sampling kits. All samples were consequently processed by two DNA isolation kits. We found that the choice of both stool sampling and DNA isolation kits have an effect on bacterial composition with respect to Gram-positivity, however the isolation kit had a stronger effect than the sampling kit. The proportion of bacteria affected by isolation and sampling kits was larger at higher taxa levels compared to lower taxa levels. The PowerLyzer PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit outperformed the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit mainly due to better lysis of Gram-positive bacteria while keeping the values of all the other assessed parameters within a reasonable range. The presented effects need to be taken into account when comparing results across multiple studies or computing ratios between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.},

The production of data has dramatically increased over the past years and processing and analysis steps are becoming more and more of a bottleneck. Limiting factors are partly the availability of computational resources, but mainly the bioinformatics expertise in establishing and applying appropriate processing and analysis pipelines. Fortunately, a large diversity of specialized software tools is nowadays available. Nevertheless, choosing the most appropriate methods for answering specific biological questions can be rather challenging, especially for non-bioinformaticians. In order to provide a comprehensive overview and guide for the microbiological scientific community, we assessed the most common and freely available metagenome assembly tools with respect to their output statistics, their sensitivity for low abundant community members and variability in resulting community profiles as well as their ease-of-use. In contrast to the highly anticipated {\textquotedbl}Critical Assessment of Metagenomic Interpretation{\textquotedbl} (CAMI) challenge, which uses general mock community-based assembler comparison we here tested assemblers on real Illumina metagenome sequencing data from natural communities of varying complexity sampled from forest soil and algal biofilms. Our observations clearly demonstrate that different assembly tools can prove optimal, depending on the sample type, available computational resources and, most importantly, the specific research goal. In addition, we present detailed descriptions of the underlying principles and pitfalls of publically available assembly tools from a microbiologist's perspective, and provide guidance regarding the user-friendliness, sensitivity and reliability of the resulting phylogenetic profiles.},

There is indeed experimental and observational evidence that exposure to these non-antibiotic antimicrobial agents can induce or select for bacterial adaptations that result in decreased susceptibility to one or more antibiotics. This may occur via cellular mechanisms that are protective across multiple classes of antimicrobial agents or by selection of genetic determinants for resistance to non-antibiotic agents that are linked to genes for antibiotic resistance. There may also be relevant effects of these antimicrobial agents on bacterial community structure and via non-specific mechanisms such as mobilization of genetic elements or mutagenesis. Notably, some co-selective adaptations have adverse effects on fitness in the absence of a continued selective pressure. The present review examines the evidence for the significance of these phenomena, particularly in respect of bacterial zoonotic agents that commonly occur in livestock and that may be transmitted, directly or via the food chain, to human populations.},

We isolated 412 antibiotic resistant bacteria from agricultural, urban and pristine soils. All isolates were multi-drug resistant, of which greater than 80{\%} were resistant to 16-23 antibiotics, comprising almost all classes of antibiotic. The mobile resistance genes investigated, (ESBL, bla NDM-1, and plasmid mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) resistance genes) were not responsible for the respective resistance phenotypes nor were they present in the extracted soil DNA. Efflux was demonstrated to play an important role in MDR and many resistance phenotypes. Clinically relevant Burkholderia species are intrinsically resistant to ciprofloxacin but the soil Burkholderia species were not intrinsically resistant to ciprofloxacin. Using a phenotypic enzyme assay we identified the antibiotic specific inactivation of trimethoprim in 21 bacteria from different soils. The results of this study identified the importance of the efflux mechanism in the soil resistome and variations between the intrinsic resistance profiles of clinical and soil bacteria of the same family.},

 abstract = {Class 1 integrons accumulate antibiotic resistance genes by site-specific recombination at aatI-1 sites. Captured genes are transcribed from a promoter located within the integron; for class 1 integrons, the first gene to be transcribed and translated normally encodes an aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance protein (either an acetyltransferase [AAC] or adenyltransferase [AAD]). The leader RNA from the Pseudomonas fluorescens class 1 integron contains an aminoglycoside-sensing riboswitch RNA that controls the expression of the downstream aminoglycoside resistance gene. Here, we explore the relationship between integron-dependent DNA recombination and potential aminoglycoside-sensing riboswitch products of recombination derived from a series of aminoglycoside-resistant clinical strains. Sequence analysis of the clinical strains identified a series of sequence variants that were associated with class I integron-derived aminoglycoside-resistant (both aac and aad) recombinants. For the aac recombinants, representative sequences showed up to 6-fold aminoglycoside-dependent regulation of reporter gene expression. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) confirmed RNA binding. Covariance analysis generated a secondary-structure model for the RNA that is an independent verification of previous models that were derived from mutagenesis and chemical probing data and that was similar to that of the P. fluorescens riboswitch RNA. The aminoglycosides were among the first antibiotics to be used clinically, and the data suggest that in an aminoglycoside-rich environment, functional riboswitch recombinants were selected during integron-mediated recombination to regulate aminoglycoside resistance. The incorporation of a functional aminoglycoside-sensing riboswitch by integron recombination confers a selective advantage for the expression of resistance genes of diverse origins.},

 abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a serious global threat for public health. Considering the high abundance of cell-free DNA encoding antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in both clinical and environmental settings, natural transformation is an important horizontal gene transfer pathway to transmit antibiotic resistance. It is acknowledged that antibiotics are key drivers for disseminating antibiotic resistance, yet the contributions of non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals on transformation of ARGs are overlooked. In this study, we report that some commonly consumed non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, at clinically and environmentally relevant concentrations, significantly facilitated the spread of antibiotic resistance through the uptake of exogenous ARGs. This included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, the lipid-lowering drug, gemfibrozil, and the \textgreek{b}-blocker propranolol. Based on the results of flow cytometry, whole-genome RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis, the enhanced transformation of ARGs was affiliated with promoted bacterial competence, enhanced stress levels, over-produced reactive oxygen species and increased cell membrane permeability. In addition, a mathematical model was proposed and calibrated to predict the dynamics of transformation during exposure to non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals. Given the high consumption of non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, these findings reveal new concerns regarding antibiotic resistance dissemination exacerbated by non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals.},

 abstract = {The widespread occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) throughout aquatic environments has raised global concerns for public health, but understanding of the emergence and propagation of ARGs in diverse environmental media remains limited. This study investigated the occurrence and spatio-temporal patterns of six classes of ARGs in cyanobacteria isolated from Taihu Lake. Tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance genes were identified as dominant ARGs. The abundance of ARGs in cyanobacteria was significantly higher in the bloom period than in the non-bloom period. The contribution and persistence of ARGs were higher in extracellular DNA (eDNA) than in intracellular DNA (iDNA) from cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria-associated eDNA carrying ARGs was more stable at lower temperature. The relative abundances of ARGs in Microcystis and Synechococcus, the dominant genera of cyanobacterial blooms in Taihu Lake, were significantly higher than those in other cyanobacterial strains. The conjugative transfer efficiency for bacterial assimilation of ARGs in cyanobacteria was facilitated by increasing temperature and cyanobacterial cell concentration. Our results demonstrated that cyanobacteria could act as a significant reservoir and source for the acquisition and dissemination of ARGs in aquatic environments, hence the definition of negative ecological effects of cyanobacterial blooms was expanded.},

Because of the continued emergence and expansion of antimicrobial resistance, combined with the lack of novel antimicrobial agents, efforts are underway to preserve the efficacy of current available life-saving antimicrobials in humans. As a result, uses of medically important antimicrobials in food animal production have generated debate and led to calls to reduce both antimicrobial use and the need for use. This manuscript, commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) to help inform the development of the WHO guidelines on the use of medically important antimicrobials in food animals, includes three illustrations of antimicrobial use in food animal production that has contributed to the selection-and subsequent transfer-of resistance determinants from food animals to humans. Herein, antimicrobial use and the epidemiology of bacterial resistance are described for streptothricins, glycopeptides, and colistin. Taken together, these historical and current narratives reinforce the need for actions that will preserve the efficacy of antimicrobials.},

Biocides are widely used to prevent infection. We aimed to determine whether exposure of Salmonella to various biocides could act as a driver of antibiotic resistance.

METHODS

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was exposed to four biocides with differing modes of action. Antibiotic-resistant mutants were selected during exposure to all biocides and characterized phenotypically and genotypically to identify mechanisms of resistance.

RESULTS

All biocides tested selected MDR mutants with decreased antibiotic susceptibility; these occurred randomly throughout the experiments. Mutations that resulted in de-repression of the multidrug efflux pump AcrAB-TolC were seen in MDR mutants. A novel mutation in rpoA was also selected and contributed to the MDR phenotype. Other mutants were highly resistant to both quinolone antibiotics and the biocide triclosan.

CONCLUSIONS

This study shows that exposure of bacteria to biocides can select for antibiotic-resistant mutants and this is mediated by clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance prevalent in human pathogens.},

 abstract = {The increased use of veterinary antibiotics in modern agriculture for therapeutic uses and growth promotion has raised concern regarding the environmental impacts of antibiotic residues in soil and water. The mobility and transport of antibiotics in the environment depends on their sorption behavior, which is typically predicted by extrapolating from an experimentally determined soil-water distribution coefficient (Kd). Accurate determination of Kd values is important in order to better predict the environmental fate of antibiotics. In this paper, we examine different analytical approaches in assessing Kd of two major classes of veterinary antibiotics (sulfonamides and macrolides) and compare the existing literature data with experimental data obtained in our laboratory. While environmental parameters such as soil pH and organic matter content are the most significant factors that affect the sorption of antibiotics in soil, it is important to consider the concentrations used, the analytical method employed, and the transformations that can occur when determining Kd values. Application of solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry can facilitate accurate determination of Kd at environmentally relevant concentrations. Because the bioavailability of antibiotics in soil depends on their sorption behavior, it is important to examine current practices in assessing their mobility in soil.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Amplicon sequencing of phylogenetic marker genes, e.g., 16S, 18S, or ITS ribosomal RNA sequences, is still the most commonly used method to determine the composition of microbial communities. Microbial ecologists often have expert knowledge on their biological question and data analysis in general, and most research institutes have computational infrastructures to use the bioinformatics command line tools and workflows for amplicon sequencing analysis, but requirements of bioinformatics skills often limit the efficient and up-to-date use of computational resources.

RESULTS

We present dadasnake, a user-friendly, 1-command Snakemake pipeline that wraps the preprocessing of sequencing reads and the delineation of exact sequence variants by using the favorably benchmarked and widely used DADA2 algorithm with a taxonomic classification and the post-processing of the resultant tables, including hand-off in standard formats. The suitability of the provided default configurations is demonstrated using mock community data from bacteria and archaea, as well as fungi.

CONCLUSIONS

By use of Snakemake, dadasnake makes efficient use of high-performance computing infrastructures. Easy user configuration guarantees flexibility of all steps, including the processing of data from multiple sequencing platforms. It is easy to install dadasnake via conda environments. dadasnake is available at https://github.com/a-h-b/dadasnake.},

 abstract = {Taxonomic classification of Clostridium botulinum is based on the production of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), while closely related, nontoxic organisms are classified as Clostridium sporogenes. However, this taxonomic organization does not accurately mirror phylogenetic relationships between these species. A phylogenetic reconstruction using 2,016 orthologous genes shared among strains of C. botulinum group I and C. sporogenes clearly separated these two species into discrete clades which showed $\sim$93{\%} average nucleotide identity (ANI) between them. Clustering of strains based on the presence of variable orthologs revealed 143 C. sporogenes clade-specific genetic signatures, a subset of which were further evaluated for their ability to correctly classify a panel of presumptive C. sporogenes strains by PCR. Genome sequencing of several C. sporogenes strains lacking these signatures confirmed that they clustered with C. botulinum strains in a core genome phylogenetic tree. Our analysis also identified C. botulinum strains that contained C. sporogenes clade-specific signatures and phylogenetically clustered with C. sporogenes strains. The genome sequences of two bont/B2-containing strains belonging to the C. sporogenes clade contained regions with similarity to a bont-bearing plasmid (pCLD), while two different strains belonging to the C. botulinum clade carried bont/B2 on the chromosome. These results indicate that bont/B2 was likely acquired by C. sporogenes strains through horizontal gene transfer. The genome-based classification of these species used to identify candidate genes for the development of rapid assays for molecular identification may be applicable to additional bacterial species that are challenging with respect to their classification.},

We benchmark the performance of eight correlation techniques on simulated and real data in response to challenges specific to microbiome studies: fractional sampling of ribosomal RNA sequences, uneven sampling depths, rare microbes and a high proportion of zero counts. Also tested is the ability to distinguish signals from noise, and detect a range of ecological and time-series relationships.

 abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a global problem affecting both human and animal health. Ensuring the strategic and effective use of antibiotics is paramount to combatting the emergence and spread of resistance. This study explored New York State (NYS) dairy farmers' perceptions regarding antibiotic use in dairy farming and antibiotic resistance. Dairy farmers' perceptions were assessed through semi-structured, in-person interviews. Twenty interviews with farm owners and/or managers of 15 conventional and five USDA certified organic dairy farms with 40 to 2,300 lactating cows were conducted. Thematic analysis was used to assess, compare and contrast transcripts for farmers' characterization of their beliefs, values, and concerns. Conventional dairy farmers had a low level of concern about the possible impacts of on-farm antibiotic resistance on human health and believed their antibiotic use was already judicious. Generally, they believed their cattle's health would suffer if antibiotic use were further curtailed. Conventional farmers expressed frustration over the possibility of more stringent governmental, milk cooperative, buyer, or marketer requirements for antibiotic use and associated animal welfare in the future. They attributed expanding regulations in part to misinformed consumer preferences, that farmers felt were influenced by the marketing of organic dairy products. Organic dairy farmers were generally more concerned about issues related to antibiotic resistance than conventional farmers. Both conventional and organic farmers placed emphasis on disease prevention through herd health management rather than treatment. In conclusion, the conventional NYS dairy farmers in this study were skeptical of the need for and benefits of reduced antibiotic use on their dairy farms. Interventions for farmers, delivered by a trusted source such as a veterinarian, that provide training about proper antibiotic use practices and information of possible financial benefits of refining antibiotic use may hold promise.},

 abstract = {Illumina's MiSeq has become the dominant platform for gene amplicon sequencing in microbial ecology studies; however, various technical concerns, such as reproducibility, still exist. To assess reproducibility, 16S rRNA gene amplicons from 18 soil samples of a reciprocal transplantation experiment were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. The V4 region of 16S rRNA gene from each sample was sequenced in triplicate with each replicate having a unique barcode. The average OTU overlap, without considering sequence abundance, at a rarefaction level of 10,323 sequences was 33.4$\pm$2.1{\%} and 20.2$\pm$1.7{\%} between two and among three technical replicates, respectively. When OTU sequence abundance was considered, the average sequence abundance weighted OTU overlap was 85.6$\pm$1.6{\%} and 81.2$\pm$2.1{\%} for two and three replicates, respectively. Removing singletons significantly increased the overlap for both ({\~{}}1-3{\%}, p{\textless}0.001). Increasing the sequencing depth to 160,000 reads by deep sequencing increased OTU overlap both when sequence abundance was considered (95{\%}) and when not (44{\%}). However, if singletons were not removed the overlap between two technical replicates (not considering sequence abundance) plateaus at 39{\%} with 30,000 sequences. Diversity measures were not affected by the low overlap as \textgreek{a}-diversities were similar among technical replicates while \textgreek{b}-diversities (Bray-Curtis) were much smaller among technical replicates than among treatment replicates (e.g., 0.269 vs. 0.374). Higher diversity coverage, but lower OTU overlap, was observed when replicates were sequenced in separate runs. Detrended correspondence analysis indicated that while there was considerable variation among technical replicates, the reproducibility was sufficient for detecting treatment effects for the samples examined. These results suggest that although there is variation among technical replicates, amplicon sequencing on MiSeq is useful for analyzing microbial community structure if used appropriately and with caution. For example, including technical replicates, removing spurious sequences and unrepresentative OTUs, using a clustering method with a high stringency for OTU generation, estimating treatment effects at higher taxonomic levels, and adapting the unique molecular identifier (UMI) and other newly developed methods to lower PCR and sequencing error and to identify true low abundance rare species all can increase reproducibility.},

Therefore any Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for a medicinal product for human use shall be accompanied by an {\textquotedbl}indication of any potential risks presented by the medicinal product for the environment{\textquotedbl} according to Article 8(3)(g) of the Directive 2001/83/EC. Since 2006 a guideline document from the European Medicines Agency (EMA, formerly EMEA) is available for this task, which is now called the {\textquotedbl}Environmental Risk Assessment{\textquotedbl} (ERA). Recently the EMA released a draft revision of an updated ERA~guideline. The present paper provides a summary of the intended innovation. A number of options have been discontinued, but some of them cannot be easily recognised, even though they are potentially affecting the MAA and its costs in a relevant way. A new specifically tailored experimental testing course for antibiotics and a secondary poisoning assessment is introduced. The selection~of required study types is altered and the environmental fate evaluation is adapted to the scientific progress. In the recent situation it is suggested that marketing authorisation applicants may reconsider the conduct of water/sediment studies for substances not requiring these according to the guideline revision. The new tailored testing approach for antibiotics avoids any vertebrate use, because it demands no fish study, therefore it may be applied henceforth. If the new prescriptions are not yet in force at the point in time of the MAA submission, appropriate waivers should be stated in the ERA. No further HPLC-study types and acute earthworm toxicity tests should be performed, since the guideline update draft does not accept them. In preclinical toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies, additional data gathering on metabolites should be considered in order to avoid unnecessary leaflet warnings. The cost for ERA may change significantly, with a tendency to increase for generic pharmaceutical MAA, but with a possible reduction for substances of low environmental concern. Earlier consideration of ERA in the drug development process is recommended.},

Thus, the total amount of prokaryotic carbon is 60-100{\%} of the estimated total carbon in plants, and inclusion of prokaryotic carbon in global models will almost double estimates of the amount of carbon stored in living organisms. In addition, the earth's prokaryotes contain 85-130 Pg of N and 9-14 Pg of P, or about 10-fold more of these nutrients than do plants, and represent the largest pool of these nutrients in living organisms. Most of the earth's prokaryotes occur in the open ocean, in soil, and in oceanic and terrestrial subsurfaces, where the numbers of cells are 1.2 x 10(29), 2.6 x 10(29), 3.5 x 10(30), and 0. 25-2.5 x 10(30), respectively. The numbers of heterotrophic prokaryotes in the upper 200 m of the open ocean, the ocean below 200 m, and soil are consistent with average turnover times of 6-25 days, 0.8 yr, and 2.5 yr, respectively. Although subject to a great deal of uncertainty, the estimate for the average turnover time of prokaryotes in the subsurface is on the order of 1-2 x 10(3) yr. The cellular production rate for all prokaryotes on earth is estimated at 1.7 x 10(30) cells/yr and is highest in the open ocean. The large population size and rapid growth of prokaryotes provides an enormous capacity for genetic diversity.},

 abstract = {Loss of gut microbial diversity1-6 in industrial populations is associated with chronic diseases7, underscoring the importance of studying our ancestral gut microbiome. However, relatively little is known about the composition of pre-industrial gut microbiomes. Here we performed a large-scale de novo assembly of microbial genomes from palaeofaeces. From eight authenticated human palaeofaeces samples (1,000-2,000~years old) with well-preserved DNA from southwestern USA and Mexico, we reconstructed 498 medium- and high-quality microbial genomes. Among the 181 genomes with the strongest evidence of being ancient and of human gut origin, 39{\%} represent previously undescribed species-level genome bins. Tip dating suggests an approximate diversification timeline for the key human symbiont Methanobrevibacter smithii. In comparison to 789 present-day human gut microbiome samples from eight countries, the palaeofaeces samples are more similar to non-industrialized than industrialized human gut microbiomes. Functional profiling of the palaeofaeces samples reveals a markedly lower abundance of antibiotic-resistance and mucin-degrading genes, as well as enrichment of mobile genetic elements relative to industrial gut microbiomes. This study facilitates the discovery and characterization of previously undescribed gut microorganisms from ancient microbiomes and the investigation of the evolutionary history of the human gut microbiota through genome reconstruction from palaeofaeces.},

 abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the role of household products as possible sources of biocidal active substances in municipal wastewater and their regulation under the Biocidal Products Regulation (EU) 528/2012. In 131 households, we investigated the prevalence of products used to control pests, washing and cleaning agents and select personal care products with high release to wastewater. Inventories of these products were established with the help of barcode scanning. All uses of biocidal active substances were evaluated regarding their assessment under the Biocidal Products Regulation. 2963 products were scanned in total, with 48{\%} being washing and cleaning agents, 43{\%} personal care products and 9{\%} products used to control pests. Biocidal active substances were found in each household. These were observed primarily in washing and cleaning agents and personal care products (90{\%}), while only a small percentage of the observations of biocidal active substances was in biocidal products. 64{\%} of the observations of biocidal active substances were in applications that do not fall under the Biocidal Products Regulation and are thus not subject to its environmental risk assessment. This study shows clearly that risks for the environment are underestimated because unregulated emissions to wastewater occur. It demonstrates that there are gaps in the current chemical legislation that lead to a release of substances into wastewater that were not subject to environmental risk assessment under the Biocidal Products Regulation. This is one example of the limitations of scientific risk assessment of chemicals - its complexity is immense. From our point of view, the results underline the importance of a sustainable use of the substances as this is the only way to decrease yet unidentified risks.},

 abstract = {Diverse members of the genus Clostridium produce botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), which cause a flaccid paralysis known as botulism. While multiple species of clostridia produce BoNTs, the majority of human botulism cases have been attributed to Clostridium botulinum groups I and II. Recent comparative genomic studies have demonstrated the genomic diversity within these BoNT-producing species. This report introduces a multiplex PCR assay for differentiating members of C. botulinum group I, C. sporogenes, and two major subgroups within C. botulinum group II. Coding region sequences unique to each of the four species/subgroups were identified by in silico analyses of thousands of genome assemblies, and PCR primers were designed to amplify each marker. The resulting multiplex PCR assay correctly assigned 41 tested isolates to the appropriate species or subgroup. A separate PCR assay to determine the presence of the ntnh gene (a gene associated with the botulinum neurotoxin gene cluster) was developed and validated. The ntnh gene PCR assay provides information about the presence or absence of the botulinum neurotoxin gene cluster and the type of gene cluster present (ha positive [ha+] or orfX+). The increased availability of whole-genome sequence data and comparative genomic tools enabled the design of these assays, which provide valuable information for characterizing BoNT-producing clostridia. The PCR assays are rapid, inexpensive tests that can be applied to a variety of sample types to assign isolates to species/subgroups and to detect clostridia with botulinum neurotoxin gene (bont) clusters.IMPORTANCE Diverse clostridia produce the botulinum neurotoxin, one of the most potent known neurotoxins. In this study, a multiplex PCR assay was developed to differentiate clostridia that are most commonly isolated in connection with human botulism cases: C. botulinum group I, C. sporogenes, and two major subgroups within C. botulinum group II. Since BoNT-producing and nontoxigenic isolates can be found in each species, a PCR assay to determine the presence of the ntnh gene, which is a universally present component of bont gene clusters, and to provide information about the type (ha+ or orfX+) of bont gene cluster present in a sample was also developed. The PCR assays provide simple, rapid, and inexpensive tools for screening uncharacterized isolates from clinical or environmental samples. The information provided by these assays can inform epidemiological studies, aid with identifying mixtures of isolates and unknown isolates in culture collections, and confirm the presence of bacteria of interest.},

Extensive literature discusses different methods for describing diversity and documenting its effects on ecosystem health and function. However, it is widely believed that diversity depends on the intensity of sampling. I discuss a statistical perspective on diversity, framing the diversity of an environment as an unknown parameter, and discussing the bias and variance of plug-in and rarefied estimates. I describe the state of the statistical literature for addressing these problems, focusing on the analysis of microbial diversity. I argue that latent variable models can address issues with variance, but bias corrections need to be utilized as well. I encourage ecologists to use estimates of diversity that account for unobserved species, and to use measurement error models to compare diversity across ecosystems.},

This puts applications such as molecular diagnostics based on the analysis of cell-free DNA or single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) out of reach. To overcome these limitations, we report a nanopore-based sequencing strategy in which short target sequences are first circularized and then amplified via rolling-circle amplification to produce long stretches of concatemeric repeats. After sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform, the resulting repeat sequences can be aligned to produce a highly accurate consensus that reduces the high error-rate present in the individual repeats. Using this approach, we demonstrate for the first time the ability to obtain unbiased and accurate nanopore data for target DNA sequences {\textless}100 bp. Critically, this approach is sensitive enough to achieve SNV discrimination in mixtures of sequences and even enables quantitative detection of specific variants present at ratios of {\textless}10{\%}. Our method is simple, cost-effective, and only requires well-established processes. It therefore expands the utility of nanopore sequencing for molecular diagnostics and other applications, especially in resource-limited settings.},

 abstract = {The emergence of mutations in nucleic acids is one of the major factors underlying evolution, providing the working material for natural selection. Most bacteria are haploid for the vast majority of their genes and, coupled with typically short generation times, this allows mutations to emerge and accumulate rapidly, and to effect significant phenotypic changes in what is perceived to be real-time. Not least among these phenotypic changes are those associated with antibiotic resistance. Mechanisms of horizontal gene spread among bacterial strains or species are often considered to be the main mediators of antibiotic resistance. However, mutational resistance has been invaluable in studies of bacterial genetics, and also has primary clinical importance in certain bacterial species, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori, or when considering resistance to particular antibiotics, especially to synthetic agents such as fluoroquinolones and oxazolidinones. In addition, mutation is essential for the continued evolution of acquired resistance genes and has, e.g., given rise to over 100 variants of the TEM family of beta-lactamases. Hypermutator strains of bacteria, which have mutations in genes affecting DNA repair and replication fidelity, have elevated mutation rates. Mutational resistance emerges de novo more readily in these hypermutable strains, and they also provide a suitable host background for the evolution of acquired resistance genes in vitro. In the clinical setting, hypermutator strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, but a more general role for hypermutators in the emergence of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in a wider variety of bacterial pathogens has not yet been proven.},

 abstract = {The acquisition of new genetic material via horizontal gene transfer allows bacteria to rapidly evolve. One key to estimating the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to bacterial evolution is to quantify the abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in bacterial communities under varying degrees of selective pressure. We quantified class 1 integrase (intI1) gene abundance in total community DNA extracted from contaminated and reference riverine and estuarine microhabitats, and in metal- or antibiotic-amended freshwater microcosms. The intI1 gene was more abundant in all contaminant-exposed communities indicating that relative gene transfer potential is higher in these communities. A second key to assessing the contributions of MGEs to bacterial evolution is to examine the structure and function of the MGE-associated gene pool. We determined that the gene cassette pool is a novel and diverse resource available for bacterial acquisition, but that contamination has no discernible effect on cassette richness. Gene cassette profiles were more similar within sites than among sites, yet bacterial community profiles were not, suggesting that selective pressures can shape the structure of the gene cassette pool. Of the 46 sequenced gene cassette products, 37 were novel sequences, while the 9 gene cassettes with similarity to database sequences were primarily to hypothetical proteins. That class 1 integrons are ubiquitous and abundant in environmental bacterial communities indicates that this group of MGEs can play a substantial role in the acquisition of a diverse array of gene cassettes beyond their demonstrated impact in mediating multidrug resistance in clinical bacteria.},

The species is naturally resistant to penicillins, and members of the population often carry acquired resistance to multiple antimicrobials. However, knowledge of K. pneumoniae ecology, population structure or pathogenicity is relatively limited. Over the past decade, K. pneumoniae has emerged as a major clinical and public health threat owing to increasing prevalence of healthcare-associated infections caused by multidrug-resistant strains producing extended-spectrum \textgreek{b}-lactamases and/or carbapenemases. A parallel phenomenon of severe community-acquired infections caused by 'hypervirulent' K. pneumoniae has also emerged, associated with strains expressing acquired virulence factors. These distinct clinical concerns have stimulated renewed interest in K. pneumoniae research and particularly the application of genomics. In this Review, we discuss how genomics approaches have advanced our understanding of K. pneumoniae taxonomy, ecology and evolution as well as the diversity and distribution of clinically relevant determinants of pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance. A deeper understanding of K. pneumoniae population structure and diversity will be important for the proper design and interpretation of experimental studies, for interpreting clinical and public health surveillance data and for the design and implementation of novel control strategies against this important pathogen.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

The present study was conducted to investigate acquired beta-lactamases and their genetic support in 26 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates that were resistant to nearly all antipseudomonal drugs from six medical centres in Taiwan.

METHODS

Acquired beta-lactamases and their genetic support were determined by PCR-based strategies.

RESULTS

Four and 16 of the 26 isolates were found to produce VIM-2 and VIM-3 metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs), respectively, and 1, 1 and 2 isolates produced OXA-17, OXA-10 and PSE-1, respectively. These bla genes are all in class 1 integrons that are probably chromosomally located. The bla(VIM-3)-containing integron, with a deletion between int1 and the bla(VIM-3) structural gene, has six gene cassettes, bla(VIM-3), a probable fosfomycin resistance determinant, aacA4, aacA4, aadB and aacA4. The bla(VIM-2)-containing integron, without detectable 5'-conserved segment, contains four genes cassettes (aacA7-bla(VIM-2)-dhfr-aacA5) and is ended by tniC. The bla(OXA-10)-containing integron includes a catB3 cassette and a fused gene cassette, which is made up of bla(OXA-17) and a novel streptomycin-spectinomycin gene, designated aadA15. The bla(OXA-17)-containing integron has three gene cassettes (aacA4-catB2-bla(OXA-17)) but the 59-base element of the bla(OXA-17) cassette is interrupted by a putative transposase gene. The bla(PSE-1)-containing integron has three gene cassettes, aacA4, an aadA3-related gene designated aadA3b and bla(PSE-1). PFGE revealed genetic diversity among the multidrug-resistant isolates from different hospitals.

CONCLUSIONS

This study demonstrated the high prevalence of VIM-type MBLs and the presence of unusual bla-encoding integrons in multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates in Taiwan. The spread of bla(VIM-2)-related genes by horizontal transfer might have occurred.},

Herein, high-throughput sequencing and high-throughput quantitative PCR were applied to profile the overall changes in microbial communities and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) of biofilms in response to a combination of naproxen and sulfamethoxazole pollution. After continuous operation for 120~days, naproxen or/and sulfamethoxazole were efficiently removed, and the salinity of 1.00{\%} enhanced the removal rate of sulfamethoxazole. The high-throughput sequencing revealed that Eubacterium spp. with abundances of over 40.00{\%} dominated in all samples, and combined pollution of naproxen and sulfamethoxazole more readily promoted the occurrence of multidrug-resistant microbes, including Pseudomonas and Methylophilus. The high-throughput quantitative PCR results showed that the combined pollution of naproxen and sulfamethoxazole increased the total abundance of ARGs to approximately 9 copies per cell. In contrast, increasing the salinity to 1.00{\%} greatly reduced the overall abundance of ARGs to below 2 copies per bacterial cell. Mantel test and Procrustes analysis indicated that microbiomes from different treatments had tight links to their respective antibiotic resistomes. Furthermore, network analysis revealed that multidrug-resistant microbes were potential hosts for greatly enriched numbers of ARGs in the combined treatment. As increased salinity eliminated those multidrug-resistant but salt-sensitive microbes, the abundance of ARGs was significantly decreased. These results showed the high probability of the transmission of ARGs in biofilms exposed to combined pollution of naproxen and sulfamethoxazole, which could be relieved by increased salinity.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE

The growing problem of drug resistance among respiratory pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae, (S. pneumoniae) has complicated initial empiric therapy of CAP. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a 3-day course of azithromycin in adults with mild to moderately severe CAP, and to determine whether in vitro macrolide resistance among strains of S. pneumoniae is related to clinical efficacy/failure.

METHODS

An open-label, non-comparative study was undertaken at 3 university-affiliated hospitals in Japan. Patients were eligible if they were 18 years or older and had mild or moderately severe CAP. All patients received azithromycin 500 mg/day for three days, and clinical and microbiological responses were evaluated 1 and 2 weeks after initiating therapy.

RESULTS

A total of 78 patients received the study medication, 59 of whom had sufficient data available for efficacy analysis. Overall, a good clinical response with azithromycin was achieved in 49 patients (83.1{\%}) and a microbiological response was achieved in 78.3{\%}. Azithromycin resistance, based on CLSI criteria, was demonstrated in 85.7{\%} (12/14) of S. pneumoniae isolates, and the presence of ermB genes was found in 50.0{\%} (7/14). However, among patients in whom S. pneumoniae was isolated (n=17), a good clinical response was achieved in 76.5{\%} (13/17), and the microbiological response rate was 64.3{\%} (9/14). Furthermore, 6 of 7 patients in whom high-level resistance was documented (MICs {\textgreater}256 microg/mL and carrying ermB genes) exhibited good clinical responses. Azithromycin was well tolerated; adverse events, mainly of a gastrointestinal nature, were recorded in 6 patients (7.7{\%}).

CONCLUSION

Most patients responed well to azithromycin, indicating that azithromycin might be clinically effective for the treatment of CAP with macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae. However, a larger study is necessary to prove the efficacy against macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Prokaryotic 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences are widely used in environmental microbiology and molecular evolution as reliable markers for the taxonomic classification and phylogenetic analysis of microbes. Restricted by current sequencing techniques, the massive sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons encompassing the full length of genes is not yet feasible. Thus, the selection of the most efficient hypervariable regions for phylogenetic analysis and taxonomic classification is still debated. In the present study, several bioinformatics tools were integrated to build an in silico pipeline to evaluate the phylogenetic sensitivity of the hypervariable regions compared with the corresponding full-length sequences.

RESULTS

The correlation of seven sub-regions was inferred from the geodesic distance, a parameter that is applied to quantitatively compare the topology of different phylogenetic trees constructed using the sequences from different sub-regions. The relationship between different sub-regions based on the geodesic distance indicated that V4-V6 were the most reliable regions for representing the full-length 16S rRNA sequences in the phylogenetic analysis of most bacterial phyla, while V2 and V8 were the least reliable regions.

CONCLUSIONS

Our results suggest that V4-V6 might be optimal sub-regions for the design of universal primers with superior phylogenetic resolution for bacterial phyla. A potential relationship between function and the evolution of 16S rRNA is also discussed.},

The new primer successfully uncovered 20 extra ARGs subtypes and 57{\%} (422/739) more unique integron array structures than the previous primers. Compared to the whole genome database, CL1s revealed in the environment in this study were of much greater diversity, having 93{\%} (900/967) novel array structures. Antibiotic resistance is the predominant function (78.3{\%} genes) carried by CL1, and a vast majority (98.6{\%} genes) of them confer resistance to aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, trimethoprim, or chloramphenicol. Additionally, 78.5{\%} unique CL1 arrays carried more than one ARGs, and 25.9{\%} of them carried ARGs of clinical relevance with high transferability potential posing threat to the general public. Our results indicated the importance of CL1s in the spread of ARGs. Overall, combining PacBio sequencing with the new primer designed in this study largely broadened our knowledge of CL1s in the environment and their significance in the environmental proliferation of ARGs.},

 abstract = {In this study, antibiotic resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) antibiotics in total microbial community in surface water in a coastal urban city was measured using a modified fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique. This FISH technique quantified the rate of antibiotic resistance to MLSB antibiotics through targeting methylation site of A2058 of 23S rRNAs resulting from expressed erythromycin ribosome methylation (erm) genes. Correlations between the rates of MLSB resistance measured by FISH and macrolide concentrations was stronger than that between the relative abundance of erm genes and macrolide concentrations, especially in residential areas where the main detected antibiotics were macrolides. These results suggest that trace levels of antibiotics in environmental waters, which was as low as 40 ng L-1, may still play important roles in the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. Additionally, methylation as a result of erm gene expression, instead of erm gene abundance, was a better indicator of selective pressure of trace level macrolides. The rates of MLSB resistance varied significantly among land use types, suggesting that anthropogenic activities are important factors to select for erm gene expression in the environment. Microbial community analysis of representative surface water samples showed that relatively high rates of MLSB resistance were observed in Alphaproteobacteria (42{\%}), Acidobacteria (36{\%}), Bacteroidaceae (32{\%}), Chloroflexi (27{\%}), and Betaproteobacteria (20.2{\%}).},

 abstract = {Motivation

Much global attention has been paid to antibiotic resistance in monitoring its emergence, accumulation and dissemination. For rapid characterization and quantification of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in metagenomic datasets, an online analysis pipeline, ARGs-OAP has been developed consisting of a database termed Structured Antibiotic Resistance Genes (the SARG) with a hierarchical structure (ARGs type-subtype-reference sequence).

Results

The new release of the database, termed SARG version 2.0, contains sequences not only from CARD and ARDB databases, but also carefully selected and curated sequences from the latest protein collection of the NCBI-NR database, to keep up to date with the increasing number of ARG deposited sequences. SARG v2.0 has tripled the sequences of the first version and demonstrated improved coverage of ARGs detection in metagenomes from various environmental samples. In addition to annotation of high-throughput raw reads using a similarity search strategy, ARGs-OAP v2.0 now provides model-based identification of assembled sequences using SARGfam, a high-quality profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM), containing profiles of ARG subtypes. Additionally, ARGs-OAP v2.0 improves cell number quantification by using the average coverage of essential single copy marker genes, as an option in addition to the previous method based on the 16S rRNA gene.

Availability and implementation

ARGs-OAP can be accessed through http://smile.hku.hk/SARGs. The database could be downloaded from the same site. Source codes for this study can be downloaded from https://github.com/xiaole99/ARGs-OAP-v2.0.

 abstract = {The spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is a growing global problem. Activated sludge (AS) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been proposed as a hotspot for ARGs. However, few studies have been conducted to uncover the temporal dynamics of the resistome of AS in WWTPs by long-term longitudinal sampling. In this study, we quantified ARGs and identified their host microbiome in a Hong Kong WWTP in 97 monthly AS samples spanning 9 years. Throughout this analysis, we demonstrated that both the abundance and structures of the resistome changed significantly every two to three years, implying that there was a successive selection of resistomes in the AS system over the study period. The detection of genes of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that are emerging major threats to public health in the AS samples, including mcr, CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) and MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus)-related genes, highlight the role of WWTPs as reservoirs of ARGs. In addition, the core resistome (abundant and persistent genes) in AS were found to overlap with those in other ecosystems such as urban sewage, livestock feces, and fishpond sediments, revealing the broad dissemination of ARGs in WWTPs and other environments. Annual variation of resistomes were explained via structural equation modeling (SEM), which deciphered the structural linkages of determining factors such as the operational parameters, microbial community composition and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Specifically, potentially relevant antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARBs) were explored and discussed based on assembly-based analyses and network correlations. Moreover, consistent with the clear relationship between resistomes and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), it was found that there was a relatively high potential for gene exchange in AS in comparison with soil genomes, which could be explained by the engineering features of WWTPs. Based on these findings, longitudinal monitoring of WWTPs is warranted for risk assessment to reveal emerging ARGs, resistome evolution, correlations with ARBs, and the potential for spread in downstream environments and concomitant exposure risks for humans.},

Selecting rigorous thresholds (e.g. e-value of 1e-10) would further accelerate SAP process.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Sequencing of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene has become a common approach to microbial community investigations in the fields of human health and environmental sciences. This approach, however, is difficult when the amount of DNA is too low to be amplified by standard PCR. Nested PCR can be employed as it can amplify samples with DNA concentration several-fold lower than standard PCR. However, potential biases with nested PCRs that could affect measurement of community structure have received little attention.

RESULTS

In this study, we used 17 DNAs extracted from vaginal swabs and 12 DNAs extracted from stool samples to study the influence of nested PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene on the estimation of microbial community structure using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Nested and standard PCR methods were compared on alpha- and beta-diversity metrics and relative abundances of bacterial genera. The effects of number of cycles in the first round of PCR (10 vs. 20) and microbial diversity (relatively low in vagina vs. high in stool) were also investigated. Vaginal swab samples showed no significant difference in alpha diversity or community structure between nested PCR and standard PCR (one round of 40 cycles). Stool samples showed significant differences in alpha diversity (except Shannon's index) and relative abundance of 13 genera between nested PCR with 20 cycles in the first round and standard PCR (P{\textless}0.01), but not between nested PCR with 10 cycles in the first round and standard PCR. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that had low relative abundance (sum of relative abundance {\textless}0.167) accounted for most of the distortion ({\textgreater}27{\%} of total OTUs in stool).

CONCLUSIONS

Nested PCR introduced bias in estimated diversity and community structure. The bias was more significant for communities with relatively higher diversity and when more cycles were applied in the first round of PCR. We conclude that nested PCR could be used when standard PCR does not work. However, rare taxa detected by nested PCR should be validated by other technologies.},

 abstract = {The class Clostridia in the phylum Firmicutes (formerly low-G+C Gram-positive bacteria) includes diverse bacteria of medical, environmental and biotechnological importance. The Selenomonas-Megasphaera-Sporomusa branch, which unifies members of the Firmicutes with Gram-negative-type cell envelopes, was recently moved from Clostridia to a separate class Negativicutes. However, draft genome sequences of the spore-forming members of the Negativicutes revealed typically clostridial sets of sporulation genes. To address this and other questions in clostridial phylogeny, we have compared a phylogenetic tree for a concatenated set of 50 widespread ribosomal proteins with the trees for beta subunits of the RNA polymerase (RpoB) and DNA gyrase (GyrB) and with the 16S rRNA-based phylogeny. The results obtained by these methods showed remarkable consistency, suggesting that they reflect the true evolutionary history of these bacteria. These data put the Selenomonas-Megasphaera-Sporomusa group back within the Clostridia. They also support placement of Clostridium difficile and its close relatives within the family Peptostreptococcaceae; we suggest resolving the long-standing naming conundrum by renaming it Peptoclostridium difficile. These data also indicate the existence of a group of cellulolytic clostridia that belong to the family Ruminococcaceae. As a tentative solution to resolve the current taxonomical problems, we propose assigning 78 validly described Clostridium species that clearly fall outside the family Clostridiaceae to six new genera: Peptoclostridium, Lachnoclostridium, Ruminiclostridium, Erysipelatoclostridium, Gottschalkia and Tyzzerella. This work reaffirms that 16S rRNA and ribosomal protein sequences are better indicators of evolutionary proximity than phenotypic traits, even such key ones as the structure of the cell envelope and Gram-staining pattern.},

The macrolide, tylosin phosphate, is often included in the diet of cattle as a preventative for liver abscesses in many regions of the world outside of Europe. This study investigated the effects of administering macrolides to beef cattle either systemically through a single subcutaneous injection (therapeutic) or continuously in-feed (subtherapeutic), on the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Mannheimia haemolytica and Enterococcus spp. isolated from the nasopharynx and faeces, respectively. Nasopharyngeal and faecal samples were collected weekly over 28 days from untreated beef steers and from steers injected once with tilmicosin or tulathromycin or continuously fed tylosin phosphate at dosages recommended by manufacturers. Tilmicosin and tulathromycin were effective in lowering (P {\textless} 0.05) the prevalence of M. haemolytica, whereas subtherapeutic tylosin had no effect. M. haemolytica isolated from control- and macrolide-treated animals were susceptible to macrolides as well as to other antibiotics. Major bacteria co-isolated with M. haemolytica from the nasopharynx included Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus spp., Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Bacillus spp. With the exception of M. haemolytica and P. multocida, erythromycin resistance was frequently found in other isolated species. Both methods of macrolide administration increased (P {\textless} 0.05) the proportion of erythromycin resistant enterococci within the population, which was comprised almost exclusively of Enterococcus hirae. Injectable macrolides impacted both respiratory and enteric microbes, whereas orally administered macrolides only influenced enteric bacteria.},

 abstract = {Pathogens are exposed to toxic levels of copper during infection, and copper tolerance may be a general virulence mechanism used by bacteria to resist host defenses. In support of this, inactivation of copper exporter genes has been found to reduce the virulence of bacterial pathogens in vivo Here we investigate the role of copper hypertolerance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We show that a copper hypertolerance operon (copB-mco), carried on a mobile genetic element (MGE), is prevalent in a collection of invasive S. aureus strains and more widely among clonal complex 22, 30, and 398 strains. The copB and mco genes encode a copper efflux pump and a multicopper oxidase, respectively. Isogenic mutants lacking copB or mco had impaired growth in subinhibitory concentrations of copper. Transfer of a copB-mco-carrying plasmid to a naive clinical isolate resulted in a gain of copper hypertolerance and enhanced bacterial survival inside primed macrophages. The copB and mco genes were upregulated within infected macrophages, and their expression was dependent on the copper-sensitive operon repressor CsoR. Isogenic copB and mco mutants were impaired in their ability to persist intracellularly in macrophages and were less resistant to phagocytic killing in human blood than the parent strain. The importance of copper-regulated genes in resistance to phagocytic killing was further elaborated using mutants expressing a copper-insensitive variant of CsoR. Our findings suggest that the gain of mobile genetic elements carrying copper hypertolerance genes contributes to the evolution of virulent strains of S. aureus that are better equipped to resist killing by host immune cells.IMPORTANCE Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a substantial threat to human health worldwide and evolves rapidly by acquiring mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids. Here we investigate how the copB-mco copper hypertolerance operon carried on a mobile genetic element contributes to the virulence potential of clinical isolates of MRSA. Copper is a key component of innate immune bactericidal defenses. Here we show that copper hypertolerance genes enhance the survival of S. aureus inside primed macrophages and in whole human blood. The copB and mco genes are carried by clinical isolates responsible for invasive infections across Europe, and more broadly among three successful clonal lineages of S. aureus Our findings show that a gain of copper hypertolerance genes increases the resistance of MRSA to phagocytic killing by host immune cells and imply that acquisition of this mobile genetic element can contribute to the success of MRSA.},

The DVCMR bioassay was used to detect effects of low and high concentrations of arsenic and arsenicals on bacterial populations in groundwater. The level of resistance of the bacterial populations to arsenate was determined by the DVCMR bioassay, and the results showed a linear correlation with the total arsenic concentrations in the monitoring well water samples; no correlation was observed by culture methods with the methods employed. Bacteria resistant to 2,000 micrograms of arsenate per ml were isolated from all monitoring well water samples studied. Strains showed similar antibiotic and heavy-metal profiles, suggesting that the arsenic was not a highly selective pressure for arsenic alone. The monitoring well water samples were amended with arsenate and nutrients to determine the biotransformation mechanisms involved. Preliminary results suggest that bacteria indigenous to the monitoring well water samples did not directly transform, i.e., precipitate or volatilize, dissolved arsenic. It was concluded that arsenic contamination of the groundwater can be monitored by the DVCMR bioassay.},

Among these, microbial degradation is the most effective and eco-friendly method. During its degradation, various microorganisms can use glyphosate as a sole source of phosphorus, carbon, and nitrogen. Major glyphosate degradation pathways and its metabolites have been frequently investigated, but the related enzymes and genes have been rarely studied. There are many reviews about the toxicity and fate of glyphosate and its major metabolite, aminomethylphosphonic acid. However, there is lack of reviews on biodegradation and bioremediation of glyphosate.

Most uses of QACs can be expected to lead to their release to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and then dispersed into various environmental compartments through sewage effluent and sludge land application. Although QACs are considered to be aerobically biodegradable, the degradation is affected by its chemical structures, dissolved oxygen concentration, complexing with anionic surfactants, etc. High abundance of QACs has been detected in sediment and sludge samples due to its strong sorption and resistance to biodegradation under anoxic/anaerobic conditions. QACs are toxic to a lot of aquatic organisms including fish, daphnids, algae, rotifer and microorganisms employed in wastewater treatment systems. And antibiotic resistance has emerged in microorganisms due to excessive use of QACs in household and industrial applications. The occurrence of QACs in the environment is correlated with anthropogenic activities, such as wastewater discharge from WWTPs or single source polluters, and sludge land application.

Here we report a new BoNT serotype, tentatively named BoNT/X, which has the lowest sequence identity with other BoNTs and is not recognized by antisera against known BoNTs. Similar to BoNT/B/D/F/G, BoNT/X cleaves vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMP) 1, 2 and 3, but at a novel site (Arg66-Ala67 in VAMP2). Remarkably, BoNT/X is the only toxin that also cleaves non-canonical substrates VAMP4, VAMP5 and Ykt6. To validate its activity, a small amount of full-length BoNT/X was assembled by linking two non-toxic fragments using a transpeptidase (sortase). Assembled BoNT/X cleaves VAMP2 and VAMP4 in cultured neurons and causes flaccid paralysis in mice. Thus, BoNT/X is a novel BoNT with a unique substrate profile. Its discovery posts a challenge to develop effective countermeasures, provides a novel tool for studying intracellular membrane trafficking, and presents a new potential therapeutic toxin for modulating secretions in cells.},

Integrons, especially the class 1 integrons, are major contributors to the acquisition and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, comprehensive knowledge of the types, content, and distribution of integrons in bacterial taxa is lacking to evaluate their contribution.

RESULTS

We have constructed a new integrase database and developed a pipeline that provides comprehensive recovery of class 1 integrons. Previous PCR-based techniques might only detect one fourth of the integron-integrases and integrons recovered in this study. By exploring the class 1 integrons in over 73,000 currently available complete and draft bacterial genomes, the contribution of class 1 integrons in spreading and acquiring ARGs was evaluated. Firstly, the host species of class 1 integrons are highly conserved within (96{\%}) in class Gammaproteobacteria, dominated by four pathogenic species of {\textquotedbl}ESKAPE.{\textquotedbl} Secondly, more than half of class 1 integrons are embedded in chromosomes with less potential for horizontal gene transfer. Finally, ARGs that have been acquired by these integrons only cover 11{\%} of all the ARG genotypes detected in bacterial genomes.

CONCLUSIONS

The above observations indicated that there are both biological and ecological limitations to class 1 integrons in acquiring and spreading ARGs across different classes of the domain Bacteria.},

 abstract = {Although widespread antibiotic resistance has been mostly attributed to the selective pressure generated by overuse and misuse of antibiotics, recent growing evidence suggests that chemicals other than antibiotics, such as certain metals, can also select and stimulate antibiotic resistance via both co-resistance and cross-resistance mechanisms. For instance, tetL, merE, and oprD genes are resistant to both antibiotics and metals. However, the potential de novo resistance induced by heavy metals at environmentally-relevant low concentrations (much below theminimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs], also referred as sub-inhibitory) has hardly been explored. This study investigated and revealed that heavy metals, namely Cu(II), Ag(I), Cr(VI), and Zn(II), at environmentally-relevant and sub-inhibitory concentrations, promoted conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) between E.~coli strains. The mechanisms of this phenomenon were further explored, which involved intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, SOS response, increased cell membrane permeability, and altered expression of conjugation-relevant genes. These findings suggest that sub-inhibitory levels of heavy metals that widely present in various environments contribute to the resistance phenomena via facilitating horizontal transfer of ARGs. This study provides evidence from multiple aspects implicating the ecological effect of low levels of heavy metals on antibiotic resistance dissemination and highlights the urgency of strengthening efficacious policy and technology to control metal pollutants in the environments.},

Many environmental studies have used next-generation sequencing methods to sequence the metagenome. However, this approach is limited as it does not identify divergent uncharacterized genes or demonstrate activity. Characterization of ARGs in environmental metagenomes is important for understanding the evolution and dissemination of resistance, as there are several examples of clinically important resistance genes originating in environmental species. The current study employed a functional metagenomic approach to detect genes encoding resistance to extended spectrum \textgreek{b}-lactams (ESBLs) and carbapenems in sewage sludge, sludge amended soil, quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) impacted reed bed sediment and less impacted long term curated grassland soil. ESBL and carbapenemase genes were detected in sewage sludge, sludge amended soils and QAC impacted soil with varying degrees of homology to clinically important \textgreek{b}-lactamase genes. The flanking regions were sequenced to identify potential host background and genetic context. Novel \textgreek{b}-lactamase genes were found in Gram negative bacteria, with one gene adjacent to an insertion sequence ISPme1, suggesting a recent mobilization event and/ the potential for future transfer. Sewage sludge and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) rich industrial effluent appear to disseminate and/or select for ESBL genes which were not detected in long term curated grassland soils. This work confirms the natural environment as a reservoir of novel and mobilizable resistance genes, which may pose a threat to human and animal health.},

The effect of cyanobacterial blooms on the dispersal and abundance of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) of concern to human health remains poorly known. We herein investigated the effect of cyanobacterial blooms on ARG composition in Lake Taihu, China. The numbers and relative abundances of total ARGs increased obviously during a Planktothrix bloom. More pathogenic microorganisms were present during this bloom than during a Planktothrix bloom or during the non-bloom period. Microcosmic experiments using additional aquatic ecosystems (an urban river and Lake West) found that a coculture of Microcystis aeruginosa and Planktothrix agardhii increased the richness of the bacterial community, because its phycosphere provided a richer microniche for bacterial colonization and growth. Antibiotic-resistance bacteria were naturally in a rich position, successfully increasing the momentum for the emergence and spread of ARGs. These results demonstrate that cyanobacterial blooms are a crucial driver of ARG diffusion and enrichment in freshwater, thus providing a reference for the ecology and evolution of ARGs and ARBs and for better assessing and managing water quality.},

Water pollution was determined to be the largest contributor to heavy metal exposure, accounting for 97.87{\%}, 92.50{\%}, 80.51{\%}, 76.16{\%} and 79.46{\%} of the Hg, Cd, As, Pb, and Cr, followed by air and soil pollution. These results can provide data to inform environmental protection policies and identify the priority pollutants that can help identify and prevent health risks due to overexposure to these heavy metal pollutants.},

 abstract = {Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) constitute emerging environmental pollutants and pose risks to public health. Toxic metals are known to select for metal-resistant bacteria in metal-contaminated soils, but there is growing concern that metal contaminants can also act as co-selective agents thereby causing environmental proliferation of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we quantified ARGs and selected mobile genetic elements (MGEs) known to constitute potential ARG hosts in 50 archived urban and suburban soils from the Belfast metropolitan area using a high-throughput qPCR ARG chip. ARG prevalence was linked to concentrations of individual metals and a soil metal toxicity index calculated based on the relative toxicity of different metals to soil microbial processes. A total of 164 ARGs were detected across the 50 soils analyzed with an average absolute abundance of 3.4 $\times$ 107 ARG gene copies per gram of soil. A significant correlation between abundance of ARGs and MGEs was observed, suggesting the importance of horizontal gene transfer for ARG dissemination. Network analysis revealed significant co-occurrence patterns between specific metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu. Hg, Ni and Zn) and associated ARGs. Path analysis further indicated that the soil metal toxicity index significantly affected the number of detected ARGs (\textgreek{l} = 0.32, P {\textless} 0.001) and the abundance of metal co-occurring ARGs (\textgreek{l} = 0.612, P {\textless} 0.001) via effects on MGEs. Collectively, our results indicate a role of soil metals in co-selection of ARGs and MGEs in urban and semi-urban soils and suggest a risk for environmental ARG dissemination via horizontal gene transfer.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Viruses are important components of microbial communities modulating community structure and function; however, only a couple of tools are currently available for phage identification and analysis from metagenomic sequencing data. Here we employed the random forest algorithm to develop VirMiner, a web-based phage contig prediction tool especially sensitive for high-abundances phage contigs, trained and validated by paired metagenomic and phagenomic sequencing data from the human gut flora.

RESULTS

VirMiner achieved 41.06{\%} $\pm$ 17.51{\%} sensitivity and 81.91{\%} $\pm$ 4.04{\%} specificity in the prediction of phage contigs. In particular, for the high-abundance phage contigs, VirMiner outperformed other tools (VirFinder and VirSorter) with much higher sensitivity (65.23{\%} $\pm$ 16.94{\%}) than VirFinder (34.63{\%} $\pm$ 17.96{\%}) and VirSorter (18.75{\%} $\pm$ 15.23{\%}) at almost the same specificity. Moreover, VirMiner provides the most comprehensive phage analysis pipeline which is comprised of metagenomic raw reads processing, functional annotation, phage contig identification, and phage-host relationship prediction (CRISPR-spacer recognition) and supports two-group comparison when the input (metagenomic sequence data) includes different conditions (e.g., case and control). Application of VirMiner to an independent cohort of human gut metagenomes obtained from individuals treated with antibiotics revealed that 122 KEGG orthology and 118 Pfam groups had significantly differential abundance in the pre-treatment samples compared to samples at the end of antibiotic administration, including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), multidrug resistance, and protein transport. The VirMiner webserver is available at http://sbb.hku.hk/VirMiner/ .

CONCLUSIONS

We developed a comprehensive tool for phage prediction and analysis for metagenomic samples. Compared to VirSorter and VirFinder-the most widely used tools-VirMiner is able to capture more high-abundance phage contigs which could play key roles in infecting bacteria and modulating microbial community dynamics.

To address this challenge, over the past decade, numerous technologies have been developed for interrogating microbial communities, of which some are amenable to exploratory work (e.g., high-throughput sequencing and phenotypic screening) and others depend on reference genes or genomes (e.g., phylogenetic and functional gene arrays). Here, we provide a critical review and synthesis of the most commonly applied {\textquotedbl}open-format{\textquotedbl} and {\textquotedbl}closed-format{\textquotedbl} detection technologies. We discuss their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages within the context of environmental applications and focus on analysis of complex microbial systems, such as those in soils, in which diversity is high and reference genomes are few. In addition, we discuss crucial issues and considerations associated with applying complementary high-throughput molecular technologies to address important ecological questions.},

 abstract = {Climate warming is increasingly leading to marked changes in plant and animal biodiversity, but it remains unclear how temperatures affect microbial biodiversity, particularly in terrestrial soils. Here we show that, in accordance with metabolic theory of ecology, taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of soil bacteria, fungi and nitrogen fixers are all better predicted by variation in environmental temperature than pH. However, the rates of diversity turnover across the global temperature gradients are substantially lower than those recorded for trees and animals, suggesting that the diversity of plant, animal and soil microbial communities show differential responses to climate change. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that the diversity of different microbial groups has significantly lower rates of turnover across temperature gradients than other major taxa, which has important implications for assessing the effects of human-caused changes in climate, land use and other factors.},

 abstract = {Antibiotic-resistant pathogens pose a significant threat to human health. Several dispersal mechanisms have been described, but transport of both microbes and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) via atmospheric particles has received little attention as a pathway for global dissemination. These atmospheric particles can return to the Earth's surface via rain or snowfall, and thus promote long-distance spread of ARGs. However, the diversity and abundance of ARGs in fresh snow has not been studied and their potential correlation with particulate air pollution is not well explored. Here, we characterized ARGs in 44 samples of fresh snow from major cities in China, three in North America, and one in Europe, spanning a gradient from pristine to heavily anthropogenically influenced ecosystems. High-throughput qPCR analysis of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) provided strong indications that dissemination of ARGs in fresh snow could be exacerbated by air pollution, severely increasing the health risks of both air pollution and ARGs. We showed that snowfall did effectively spread ARGs from point sources over the Earth surface. Together our findings urge for better pollution control to reduce the risk of global dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes.},
